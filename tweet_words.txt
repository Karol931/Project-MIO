both candidates are looking sharp now it's up to the mouth and the mind 
hard for biden to justify libya mess but doing best he can 
biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching 
pretty even debate but don't force obama into a war he would be the wrong leader 
excellent story on very good moment for ryan 
biden's statements on medicare are very effective ryan must now come back and combat 
pretty even debate no knockouts however ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger what do you think 
going over to now to introduce cast etc watch

diet coke tweet had a monster responsedammit i wish the stuff worked
my interview discussing the stakes for tonight's debate and the state of my stock portfolio 
all the morons that cause the controversy in scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated

had a great time with last night on the intrepid paul is terrific
it's amazingmy weekly scheduled interviews on and draw the highest ratings and they get bigger week by weekthanks folks
the coca cola company is not happy with methat's okay i'll still keep drinking that garbage

i was just told by one of the top players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country very nice complimenti agree
getting ready to watch the debate as they say let's get ready to rumble
why hasn't obama created jobs
why has obama let china and others take our jobs
good response on jobs by 
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices
so far is winning big
 looks much stronger and much more presidential
obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn't he done it it's all talk
obama just said was a very successful investor big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility
obama is looking rhetorical and weak is looking strong and sharp
obama weak on immigration all words no action he's been prez years
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton
 much better on libya and middle east problems obama has no answer
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama no wonder nothing gets done
you talk tough mr president but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy
obama better than last time but again wins good night 
debate showed these guys really hate each other at one point it looked like they would come to blows
george will said best debate he ever saw if you ever heard george will speakboring anything is exciting
stupid george will gave no chance months ago take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy
verlander pitched great but look truly defeated
at the debate the president kept talking of what he is going to do i kept saying why didn't he do it he lost me a long time ago
remember i said derek don't sell your trump world tower apartmentits been lucky for you the day after he sold it he broke his foot
i still love derek he is a winner
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal if we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period
do you believe barack hussein obama aka barry soetoro looked like a president last night i don't
obama did much better than he did last timebut still lost decisively
polls are starting to look really bad for obama looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win don't put it past him
my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth
my twitter followers will soon be over million all the biggies it's like having your own newspaper

great article on wind turbines by robert bryce in today's 
wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances environment of many countries communities
remember new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care
robert bryce congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines how destructive they are windmills are a disaster
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally aesthetically
all the guys that said would lose are rapidly coming on board mitt will remember the early helpers
obama was beaten but not knocked out he lives to fight another day but in the real world presidents are not given a second chance
bad decisions can be devastating
trump was right 'obama's america' tops documentaries via 
 scored last night on both substance and style
obama at big debate disadvantagehe just can't get away from his bad record
obama talks about what he is going to dowhy the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first years when he had all votes necessary
george steinbrenner would have gotten out of arod's contract three years agobut put arod in tonight
cc is a great pitcher and can handle pressure will win tonight so far my predictions have all been correct

 if we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos replace it with junk that doesn't cont 
 should really be ashamed about his massive box office disaster take a hint and get out of the film cont 
 bring back he is back
i find it very sad that we have a president with zero private sector experience attacking an opponent for being successful
if obama goes after mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then mitt should ask for obama's college recordsall of them

congrats to scotland's sunday post newspaper for its front page article 
this is my last election after my election i have more flexibility obama to discussing our nuclear arsenal
obama is an easy target on foreign policy has many openings to attack especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden
everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart in a couple of years he will thank me be smart robert
according to obama spoke to rev wright about getting out the black vote no surprise that they still speak
even though obama dumped the reverend like robert should dump kristin
 will a great job tonighthe is a real pro and respected by both sides
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obamajust wait and see
i look forward to hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after hrs
 keeps winning the ratings race thats why he is a champion
why don't we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden they don't seem to be happy with obama claiming credit all he did is say ok
 thanksand doing great business from all over the world
 thanksa great compliment
former obama white house economic adviser gave his old boss a 'c' on the economy pretty generous
my good friends in connecticut have a great opportunity to send an amazing businesswoman to washington vote for for senate
i have watched for years she will bring jobs business back to connecticutincredible woman
well this is it the final debate let's see how it goes i'll be tweeting live
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight always treated me fairly
 looks much calmer and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward
stop congratulating obama for killing bin laden the navy seals killed bin laden 
i will be doing at 
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night viewership will be way down
the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obama's failed foreign policy and i mean much more
 of the chinese say they are better off than they were years ago at least someone has done well under obama
i always said that had to keep fighting the charges by stopping he gave his enemies an opening
no matter what happens in the election deserves a lot of credit he has kept obama in it even with his terrible record
casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent from a director's point of view steven spielberg
lance armstrong fought for years then just ran out of energy very sad storyalthough they caught him red handedhe definitely cheated
doesn't the us have better things to do than to destroy an american hero for the world to see now other cont 
when the military informed obama that they had bin laden is there anyone with a brain that would not have said ok go get him
the military and navy seals should be given more credit for bin laden's death not obama who works hard to take cont 
my interview discussing last nights presidential debate my stock picks and tomorrows big announcement 
 should have been more aggressive last night yet some polls have him winning the debate
mitt romney must start congratulating the navy seals and military on bin ladens killing not the president
china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject
my announcement is tomorrow
barack obama said absolutely not times before he agreed to go after bin laden now he wants all of the credit
last night was the first time obama said we instead of i in respect to bin laden's killing
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert kristeni don't have time except to say robert drop her she cheated on you will again
 did an excellent job as debate moderator last night i only wish mitt was more aggressive
thank you to reviewer who stated 'you've been trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters
that it was hard not to end up rooting for trump
 should never have played that piece of garbage documentary yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course
no wonder is in such big trouble boss was just firedthey are lost

the response has been fantastic actually overwhelming thank you
virtually all presidents and candidates including john mccain bill clinton george hw bush and george w bush 
rt trump to give million to charity if obama releases records 
my offer to obama is about transparency in american people were sold on hope and change this our last chance to get the full record
third rate took every negative tweet or response they could find put it outwhen in fact the response is incredibly positive
glad to hear supports my offer to obama as sean says it is an easy million to charity what does obama have to lose
i just learned that has no credibilitytotal phonies that don't report the truth a puppet of obama
rt trump to obama million donation to charity if you release passport and college records 
i am happy to donate million to a charity barack obama chooses all i am asking is that he is transparent with the american people
obama has no problem leaking national security secrets why can't he release his records especially when m is going to charity
 by releasing his records he can come clean with the american people and have million go to a charity
in light the benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that obama has no problem lying to the american public
glad to hear north carolina is solid for it started trending for mitt solidly after my speech at the convention
just stated by a total pro you are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking
trump offers million for obama college passport records by 
donald trump announcement million for obama college records via 
trumps big announcement hell give million to charity of obamas choice if by 
my interview discussing my m charitable offer to obama his lack of transparency my tremendous support 
i am happy to have started really enjoying reading everyone's tweets
rt i wonder if knows what he started charity
the fact that we still don't know these things about barack obama is the point on 's show last night
the will die just like newsweeksame management
how does get a conservative platform she is a dummyjust look at her past
excited to announce that will be hosting the miss universe pageant great ratings for miss universe
miss universe pageant will be airing live on december th open invite stands for robert pattinson
still waiting for an explanation about why did not name their son donald unbelievable
 barbara unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcementyou just don't get it
 will apologize to me just like she did when i was right about besides i get great ratings on the view
 why did you choose me as one of the most fascinating people of the year last season and more than once
our side needs donald trump on s show last night thanks ann
i am offering the chance for barack obama to redistribute m to any charity of his choice everyone wins take the deal
 shouldnt be too upset over he will always do great
 i fully supported mccain but when he lost hoped obama would be great for us he wasn't
what will be the response on wednesday if obama doesn't take the million dollars for charity
 has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting
trump offers to donate million to charity if obama releases college transcripts via 
i hope derek jeters recovery is going well he is a very special player and a great guy new york loves him 
china is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports we need to rein them in
yesterday barack obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in china i don't think this was a gaffe
for someone who demanded years of mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate m to charity for his records is an easy go
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires
doing david letterman tonight at st nite of sweepsgoing into the lion's den but i've been there many times before enjoy
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent
the dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants the america we deserve
letterman was great last night i had a lot of fun you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the for charity
lots of response that obama should give the m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi
another great charity that the m could go to just a recommendation to the pres the wounded warriors represented so well by 
instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause
based on the ovation last night from the letterman audience i believe it will be hard for obama to throw m down the drain
 re taylor and conorgreat news for taylor
 only because he has something to hide
 sounds like a good idea
 i love the wounded warriorsobama should choose that as his m charity
the letterman show really turned things around people finally understand my million dollar offer to charity 
 thanks tylar
 i hope so for the charity's sake
 great idea
 i will soon start naming magazines that i think will foldi predicted newsweek

 it is a very effective commonly used business tool
people buy deals immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals
 icahn kravis apollo most othersbut nobody says they went bankrupt
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool
speaker john boehner who i like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazingthe funny thing is he cant stand them
so far he has been a complete failure at doing so he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career
an individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me
 is right to expect yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs working at home she is doing a great job

 you've got it mixed up chechnya is not the czech republic
david pecker would be a brilliant choice as ceo of time magazine nobody could bring it back like david 
 should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day get back to reporting
 i just watched the documentary it was a onesided piece of garbagea total disgrace
get all the info then quick trial then death penalty for the boston killer of innocent children and people do not be kind
 maybe anthony weiner can serve as editor in chief but then would become xrated
should be public execution for all to seeyou will end this bullshit fast
 what good will killing himher do he'll never kill againand others will start to think about consequences
 tell the victims and their families about this guy's rights terrible
you must be kiddingzero chance he is innocent
read my tweets you dopesof course he should get a trialbut fast not a year disaster
is the boston killer eligible for obama care to bring him back to health
 you are quite literally the worst human being ever thank you
 in my opinion you are the best human being ever i like that betterthank you
 this may be the best tweet in the history of twitters existence you are too kind

oh no they are worried that they didn't read the boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument year case to finish t
i just won a big court decision ny post against some character who claimed i owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties
the shirts and ties at macy's are so goodbeautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piecel kicked his ass
i hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the boston killer as the suspect
when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killingsmaimings
didn't the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away we are not dealing with an innocent baby heredeath
i know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually i'm a very compassionate person with a very high iq with strong common sense
you are right the media is always offending donald trumpthey have no limitsbut they will do anything not to offend the boston killer
 great

its freezing in new yorkwhere the hell is global warming
ive always been a fan of steve jobs especially after watching apple stock collapse wout him but the yacht he built is truly ugly
this past sundays allstar celebrity continued to win the key demographic of adults an amazing run
 dont worry my ad will be shown across the worldand it is highly accurate
the dying s circulation has dropped its newsstand sales have plummeted by percent 
did the boston terrorists register their guns no another example of why gun control legislation is not the answer

 why dont you just get in there and run for president you got all our votes thanks
wrong used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work they deftly changed it to climate changebecause it's freezing

 like ugly bird killing wind turbines
 they devalue everything stupid
 please run for president jon stewart would destroy you jon l is not smart enough
 perhaps but the country is in really big trouble i do love real estate though and am seriously good at it
 advertising standards authority has ruled antiwindfarm ad misleading political ruling to save joker salmond
 victim never died so they would not have been given death penaltybut did you see what these innocent boys were doing
the central park five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain thehorrific crimes of these young men while in park
 advertising standards authority has ruled antiwindfarm ad misleading not misleading very truthful
 but they didn't do it you wished death on innocent children who were brutally attacking people in park
 jon stewart is much smarter than you jon l isn't even close
 i firmly believe that is the most superior troll on the whole of twitter that is alla great compliment
 thanks
 but then there would be no celebrity apprentice i would die without it and so would others
 the fucking truth we need our jobs back that won't happen without new leadership

 they were viciously attacking other people in the parknice guys
 great
 didn't some other guy admit to actually committing this brutal crime yes but they committed other attacks
 the point of the documentary is that they were innocent they were attacking innocent people in the park
 where is the evidence all over the place
 so should the makers of this documentary be fired no but they should state the true factsno angels
 they were wildin they were creating a nuisanceand they were viciously attacking and robbing people
 what other attacks read the transcripts etc
 why don't you just block the morons that try annoy you they make me feel even smarternot worth the effort
 this from the guy who advocated freedom for mike tyson oh i guess i'm not a racist

i have a lot of stock and i miss steve jobs tim cook must immediately increase the size of the screen 
the white house correspondents' dinner was so boring this year i guess thats because i didnt attendeven 
next year should be the comedian at the white house correspondents dinner the only problem is that 
failed show i have never heard of you and was told you are a loserafter reading your credits i have no questions about it
 i hear your filmography is stacked with failures
 but you only want to talk about years later when i still win pm in all key demos 
failed show season of had million viewers and million watching
 season still at pm in all key demos despite having to serve as our own lead in from pm news loves trump
 perhaps one of the worst replacements in showbiz once you went on it was over your taste sucks
 i'm in front of the camera and behind the camera just looked at your picture you'll never be in front of the camera
one hit wonder i notice you are not disputing all of the failures that i said you had let's talk about it

fracking poses zero health risks in fact it increases our national security by making us energy independent
obamacare is a disaster americans will see record increases in their premiums and inferior care services
oil should not cost more than a barrel ideally it should be cheap to produce and we protect the opec countries
nbc terminates the chris matthews show

 these poor guys were proven innocent oh really weren't these poor guys mugging other people in park
 why did they all sign confessions and how many people did they mugg that night in the park what about their criminal records
 your show ratings are off the charts why do others fail to get it right because they don't want to
 a totally one sided documentary why weren't the police detectives and prosecutors interviewed city should not settle this case
 i never knew but thanks for the compliment
just took a look at time magazinelooks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot the sad end is comingjust like newsweek
 they're going to make you their person of the year in attempt to silence you they are not smart enough to do that
 great idea did you see their list a joke

 jordan is great
 small man large ego no large man ' large ego
jodi arias has stated that she follows me on twitter so i really hate to be saying that she is guilty but sadly she is as guilty as it gets
jodi should try but the govt should not make a deal no jury could be dumb enough to let her off but you never know look at oj others
jodi if you're listening make a deal
allstar celebrity is down to the five final contestants getting fired now is when it really hurts

trump int'l puerto rico spreads luxury residences a world class golf resort beach club across acres 
obamas goal of million electric car sales is a little off by over b of our money wasted
our trade deficit is still on pace to be over b this is killing our manufacturing sector and sending jobs overseas
why are some more concerned with granting terrorist rights than protecting innocent americans
turn to qvc now to watch melania really good stuff
how much money can you stand to lose thats how much risk you should assume think like a billionaire

 i don't understand the trolls that follow celebrities to curse them out on a daily basis losers
 jon stewart calls you fckface von clownstick what's that all about he's an overrated assholetotal phoney
 thank you for being a great inspiration to us in the younger generation we need more leaders like youthanks
always get even when you are in business you need to get even with people who screw you think big
 unlike you stupid i became a big stock market investor a couple of years ago because the dollar is going to hell false low int
 what happened to turn the other cheek sorry not a believer
 i may strongly disagree with 's politics but he makes one hell of a dress shirt at a great price at macy's
it's crunch time this sunday's allstar celebrity 's task will separate the winners from the losers
 remember when was going to sue you i can't sue himmy shirts and ties are doing great at macy's
most people think small because most people are afraid of success afraid of making decisions afraid of winning the art of the deal
amazing how the haters losers keep tweeting the name fkface von clownstick like they are so original like no one else is doing it
whats funny about the name fkface von clownstick it was not coined by jon leibowitz he stole it from some moron on twitter
if jon stewart is so above it all legit why did he change his name from jonathan leibowitz he should be proud of his heritage
jon stewart is a total phony he should cherish his pastnot run from it
as ive said many times before jon stewart is highly overrated
time magazine should name david pecker of american media to be its top guybut they are not smart enough to do that
looking forward to being the guest of honor at 's patriot's award gala dinner in washington dc

 i dont care for stewart but do you ever shut up i never give up
 go on his show and teach him how its done no joke writers he is soft and easy
 i wish you'd spend more time building people up rather than tearing them down i only tear down losers
 what do you think of i don't think of bill maher and nobody else does either
 why are you giving away money this am because so many people need help
 and jon stewart is a very little man hiding behind lot's of high priced writers without which he would be nothing
i would absolutely kill jon stewart in a debate it would be no contest he's not fast enough or smart enough only obnoxious enough
i'm giving away money am trump tower be there or be left behind

 remember that one time you came to that was cool of you thanks i loved it great school
 mark cuban can't beat me at anything he is one of many on shark tank and apprentice has been a much much bigger show
 is that why youve filed for bankruptcy numerous times i never filed for bankruptcy asshole
 little jon stewart is getting his ass kicked and you and all of his high priced writers know it don't panic jon
 mr trump do you support the death penalty yes
 u were right jodi arias should have listened to u thanks but i'm glad she didn't
 which internet test told you this i would like to match wits with the trumpster you wouldn't have a chance
a warren buffett corp is currently ensnared in a bankruptcy likewise icahn kravis apollo and many others have played the gamethanks
 and yet he refuses to release his iq results to the public what are you hiding mr trump ask obama
 i'd bet my life savings obama has a higher iq than you you would lose
 would you rather have a rd obama term or make out with rosie i'll take the third term
sadly firing can be an essential and responsible business decision it isn't pleasant but lopping off a branch can save a tree

just left trump national doral in miami under massive construction the blue monster will be one of the greatest courses ever built
 the only thing i ever watch on tv is 's all star celebrity apprentice 
 he is a lord for a reason but nobody can figure out what that reason is
 do you ever take the high road when i'm dealing with garbage like sugar no
 i never endorsed judd i'm with senator mitch all the way

 woohoo have lived in doral for years and city is excited for trump upgrades welcome thanks
 you must be kidding i kicked both of their ugly assses
 stewart wouldn't have even a little chance in a debate with me he's totally overrated not fast enough or smart enough

 mr trump some of these losers just don't get it they need to look at why your on top
 thank you and very true

 thanks no wonder our country is in such trouble
 is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television the benefactor now he is one of many on a modest ratings show s t
the apprentice on the other hand has been a major television hit often times finishing even now after seasons it wins its slot
 but i love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do
the success of shark tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of the apprentice one of the biggest hits in tv history
 can't hold acandle to donaldtrump he is a laughing stock in great britain but his show pays me lots of money so i'm happy
 mark cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing t shirts no strength
 i never seen apprentice or shark tank am i a fat loser no just a loser
 based on your picture i can see why you look lost and in need of a cheap lifeline
 i'm a big fan but sometimes you just need to shut upyou talk too much probably true but i'm having fun
 damn you really like getting fired up to squash you like a bug huh he doesn't have the strength
 the real shark tank is the boardroom on 
 i have turned family and friends into fans nothing better
 time for you to instruct the bbc to replace him he has the personality of a tea bag
 hadn't even heard of 'the benefactor' til donald mentioned it big fail donald wins the tv war
 you win on tv shows hands down you are a successful person i love all the shows u have come up with
 thanks and true
 thanks chris they know the real facts but don't choose to use themvery dishonest

 thank you for fund anything mr trump you know how to help people in all the right ways with hope
 every time i read a chapter it gives me a push and brings positive energy to my life think big 
 think big is the most amazing book i have ever read 
 if you real art of the deal you'd know that donald did it all on his own
 is a great american a role model to many read all of his books been a fan since he was in wwe a great guy
 that would be great philip

 wind power is inefficient and a hazard to the environment
 true
 thanks professor trump dr john trump uncle for many years at mit good genes i get it
 apparently you think you're funnier as well actually i do and i don't have writers
 is it true that it was your idea for steve to name his company wynn or is that urban legendi helped

 congratulations on win in chicago today thank you this woman played the age card and made up a story
the so called year old lady was a vicious and skilled investor who was trying to rip me off with made up facts and a blowhard lawyer
jury was unanimous after hearing the made up case against my co filed many years ago sheand her pathetic lawyer should pay me big damages
i loved beating these two terrible human beings i would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer he is a total loser
 congrats mr trump frivolous lawsuits are a big problem in this country and issue should be addressed
 she should sue her attorneys they knew she wasn't going to win with a binding contract
 counter sue for your loss of time if you want but it might be easier to let it go glad you won and had justice
 i agree she tried to ruin the good old trump brand you can not let her get away with it true
 she trusted you her mistake you beat her out of her k she was mean and trusted noone you're easy to beat
 you are powerless online and powerless in real life why do you followme moron
 mr trump even though i'm not a republican i wrote your name on my ballot during the election a wise move
 shelly kulwin says your a lyin' dog mr trump shelly kulwin is a really bad lawyer who lost big todayfool
 why people who are your haters feel they have to talk to you or follow you they are sick and mentally weak
 thanks joannah they are sad and lost people
 thanksand great job davidwhat a great evening

 true
 thank you i think
 that sounds greata bad woman
thank you for all of the positive response on my chicago lawsuit victory yesterday most of you saw through the phony age card ploy
mrs goldberg who filed the chicago case many years ago is a vicious and conniving womanloved beating her
let's see whether or not chuck townsend is smart enough to fire graydon carter who only cares about his bad food restaurants
 thanks
 thanks

 nobody does the twitter thing quite like that man engages his critics like nobody i've seen before t
 i do thanks
 wrong totally proved my case but didn't get damages because the libel laws in this country suck
 lol what is going on why is threatening you he's afraid to use his real nametoo costly
it should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting they will no longer be so brave
 just out of curiosity what makes you care so much about what they think i study cowards and stupid people
 no ones scared of you donald you are very wrong
 go fuck yourself you dumb fuck when was the last time you had a datesuch terrible language picture
i was just told by a television pro thay is one of the truly dumbest guys in the businesshe's obsessed with tso many flops

 come on danny are u afraid of the deal be careful i'm really good at deals
remember you are not even the real boss of modern family no big 's for you

 danny you're not having fun you are getting your ass kicked afraid to make the deal
 i hope you pick up a lot of twitter followers by this so people can see what a total asshole you are
no it's making you crazy because you don't have the guts to play the game come on danny you can do it
hope everyone is watching the finale rerun of celebrity apprentice on cnbcespecially the haters and losers it is on right now

 did we ever get to the details of the deal no danny doesn't have the guts to play the game
 thank you i was dealing with a very bad person
 the pres needs some helpcan you teach him the words you're fired
 yes i loved loved loved doing show i loved it all every minute i'd do it again
 is a weak and ineffective guy with a long string of failed shows who got his ass kicked last nighthe's afraid to make the wager
the lawyer i just beat in chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than come on danny make the bet
if competed against me andwon which not too many people do he could win millions of 's for himself or his charity
come on take the bet show your friends and family your bosses on modern family that you're not chicken shit
 ca is the best i rather loose my inheritance then have to watch the dreadful modern family on abc

sorry folks got to go to work now but i'll be baaaaack
 it's hilarious to see all these dumbasses hating on you i bet it feels good to laugh at them
 donald doesn't take shit from anyone run for president already interesting
 whoawhat are they so mad about don't worry it's just the same old losers and haters
 i never went bankrupt just like buffett icahn kravis and paulson as you know
 i hear ya mr trump but arguing with the left is like punching yourself in the face a pointless endeavor
 i'll never respond to your asinine bet you're gutless danny and you don't even know what the bet isloser
 mr trump why do you engage these dumb ass people you're so much better then any of them fun
 thanks
 during your inaugural address tell obama you're fired stranger things have happened

according to bill o'reilly of all the shootings in new york city are blacksif you add hispanics that figure goes to white
sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanicsa tough subjectmust be discussed
when it comes to violent crime and if we are going to solve the problem we must stop being so politically correctmust tell it like it is
likewise the primary victims of violent crimes are in the african american and hispanic communities these people want law and order now
 ask him about central park yea ask me about the muggers
 not concerned about themweren't they brutally mugging people in the park go check your facts
 good luck if i had known id have come to shake your hand fab job in aberdeen
 when you die in or years the world will be a better place i know i will make it that way
 i'm puerto rican and i agree with this we need to stop trying to be so politically correct
 the show is a joke in comparison to the original apprentice but it does pay me a lot of money
i can't believe the yankees continue to pay a rod they have a perfect right to stop paying and should have stopped a long time ago

re hiring contractors remember the cheapest isn't always the best their work may have to be redone they may not be reliable
fact the reason why americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because obama refuses to pass a budget
if fm needs to litter scotland w ugly industrial wind turbines to gain independence he will lose 
if the gov't shuts down it is because obama wants to make working americans buy obamacare while businesses and gov't are exempt
 is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down scotlands throat he's hated for it
first minister will be destroying the beauty of scotland with his insane desire for bird killing wind turbines

 great job on mr trump 
 why isnt mainstream media all over this like trayvon martin storywill there be justice for chris lane
you must admit that bryant gumbel is one of the dumbest racists around an arrogant dope with no talent failed at cbs etcwhy still on tv
 doesn't have better things to do like investigating ted cruise you can't even spell his name
 who is bryant gumbel a racist dope with a long and deep record of failure
 damn bryant gumbal is so not relevant on the scale of anything so true
 i had no idea bryant gumbel was still on tv another issue of someone using you to gain a little relevancy
 who plays more golf yourself or the president my money is on potus you win

 eric schneiderman trying to get himself an image as a strong man is suing bad choice trump will eat him alive
 thank you
lightweight ag eric schneiderman who has been a total failure in office failed to report the approval rating of students for courses
why did failing ag eric schneiderman after years of looking file his pathetic lawsuit on a saturday afternoon unheard of no case
why is it that eric schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after jon corzine and big abusers for billions
why did lightweight ag eric schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions also recent asks
how can an attorney general ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case a total sleazebag
after years of long stops then starts why did dopey eric scheiderman tell people in the trump org this case is going awaywe have no case
what did our very stupid ineffective ag eric schneidean during his trips to my office tell me about president obama governor cuomo
 as for i have only ever heard great things from former students don't sweat it
 just swat that nat out of the air and roll on donald sadly he's abusing the system
 corzine is a evil schemer who stole billion trump starts a university to help people get rich he's bad
 i wish there were more people in the world like you thanks for all you do your an awesome person thanks
 the last ag was publicity oriented tooclient but much smarter than schneiderman
 mrtrump i just wanted u know i agree w urespect you thanks
 win the lawsuit than countersue for slander and damages 
 lawsuit against trump university is without a doubt political
 schneidean is in trouble history shows that will publicly lambaste this guy to the point of surrender
 you are asking some really good questions the truthful answers will come in time they always do
wow l just found out that ag schneiderman met with president obama in syracuse on thursday and sued me on saturday same as irs etc

 very cool thanks
has ag schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions we will find out
the lightweight hack schneiderman told ivanka that the case is weak and more meets with obama then files one day later

 what an awful piece on about hbo should be ashamed very dishonest piece by racist gum
 bill gates has nothing on donald trump 
 i'm going to keep tweeting and annoying you until you run for president that's ok with me
 jeff has been battling cancer for years huge fan and trump supporter as am i 
 what was racist about that story the story wasn't racist just inaccurate and wrong bryant is dumb racist
 actually i think it was factual and right on the mark you are a vulture sir nothing more thank you
 one day i hope to be successful a bit controversial like keeping things interesting classy go for it
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington he doesn't want to detract from his press glory
i give the president's speech a on the scale of to not bad but room for improvement
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria why can't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise
that said the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess not uswe should start rebuilding our own country military
 a few billion more dollars but i'd rather say president trump than president gates
 why obama is giving up the element of surprise in syria perhaps because he is stupid
 the one who talks much does nothing except make billion dollars go get a job dumbass
 no dopey i would not go into syria but if i did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools
i wonder what the great generals like patton the big m or robert e lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria watch russia as they say in the movies shoot first and talk later
let the arab league take care of syria why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack
the united states needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first

is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria our leaders don't know what they are doing
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the us will look very bad
how bad has our leader made us look on syria stay out of syria we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize
 not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war so true
 he's to soft of a president incompetent would be a better word
 for once the uk has seen sense and not been dragged into this they were for once very smart
 what would you do give a solution vs being so critical i would make america great again
 we need a strong minded potus in office before we enter into another war
 i would be totally surprised if the us even has any money to spend on syria we don't
 i usually agree with you not tonight stop criticizing the presidenti will when he makes good decisions
 the president of syria is killing people inhumanly but the so called rebels may be just as bad or worse
 if trump was potus we would have all the money we need that's true
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syriabig mistake if he does not
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack
syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locationsamazing
 may be many things but one thing he is is right thank you sort of
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes call it the plenty of notice war
obama now just wants to save face russia is now telling him don't do it he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune laugh at us
be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii
 i'm scared for my future you should be
 can't say obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war general patton would not be happy right now
 thank you
did anyone notice that obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us he couldn't even get britain no leadership
 just from reading his tweets it seems like could run our country much better than our president right now
 he's no churchill he might not even be jimmy carter
 obviously amateur hour at the wh obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so
 donald you are antiobama no matter what obama does you will take the opposite view wrongall on merit
 wondering if u know or care that tomorrow begins childhood cancer awareness month
 thank you
 happy birthday
 just bought some beautiful trump cuff links great
 you have real talent
 you always have something negative to say about obama dont you yes
 good luck
president obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly in more ways than money attack on syria
 you should be president save america thank you
 so true
it is truly amateur hour at the white house and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now
 my son joey survived leukemia he is is now thank you makeawish and nccf for everything they did
 i've always looked up to business and politics he's the man thank you
 how would you treat the syria situation if president i'd let them all fight with each otherfocus on us
 any chance you'll change your mind and run for president time will tell
the arab league stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on syria but they want us to attackare our leaders insane or just stupid
why isn't the arab league paying for everything and sending troops they want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves
we have given syria so much time and informationthere has never been such an instance in wartime history syria is now fully prepared
 why isn't president instead of obama that is truly a good question
 you should be our next president this country would be in much better shape if you would have run in true
 that's the plan have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life i am stunned daily
in war the elememt of surprise is sooooo importantwhat the hell is obama doing
 thanks
 it's so bad there are actually maps of targets now in where usa ships would attack from
 with all due respect bush did exactly the same thing in iraq you will seldom see me defending bush
 roast of will be the best one since ok as long as mine remains number one
 please run for potus america desperately needs a true leader with common sense thank you
 actually should be a first guest to show thanks for your nice remark
each time i see one of anthony weiner's television ads for mayor i ask what the hell is he doing just wasting money timego get a job
eliot spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done and now he wants to be comptroller thrown out of politics and off of tv crazy
 glad to find you thank you for your philanthropic work thank you
 agree completely mr trump for president thanks
 after arsenio won celebrity apprentice he told me in tears that i would be his first guest if he got a show no interest
 when you are president will you be able to bring back hope jobs and cash we have no choice
 i love you djt sr for president thanks
 i realize what a mess we're in by watching then i read tweetslike a breath of fresh airthanks
 run for prime minster in the uk and first minister in scotlandwe could use your help cute
 donald have you noticed how so many people want you to run amazing i think you will win handily thanks
 i hope runs for president for obvious reasons
 james franco is prettier than donald trump but i get better ratings
 i am surprised weiner is so delusional to think that he still has a shot should seek help
 if you ever become president of the us what would be your first step get rid of obamacare
 you always keep it realmr trumpthe truth hurts sometimes and america needs you to run in 
 your thoughts on bill de blasio for mayor i predicted two years ago that he would win
 trump tower here in chicago is such an impressive building and architecturally really fits in with the area
our country is looking very bad right now
if the us attacks syria and hits the wrong targets killing civilians there will be worldwide hell to pay stay away and fix broken us
think of it the arab league doesn't want to get involved with syria but they want us to do their dirty work how stupid
 but if we had a republican president you would say the exact opposite right wrong
 if the government just listened to this country would be so much better
president obama's arab spring is not looking so good right now
 why the hell are you always criticising obama because he is doing a terrible in fact embarrassing job
i applaud columbia south carolina for cleaning up biz center will cut crime advance commerce
enjoy the ratings of president obama 
china opec and russia laugh at us but now thanks to obama so does syria very sad
i am giving away money check the crowdfunding site raise money for anything
a big key to winning is knowing where the other side is coming from think like a champion
how can general martin dempsey tell obama that delaying the syria bombardment will have no consequences he is no patton or macarthur
 thanks
 great
elections have consequences obama just published final regulations for obamacares individual mandate enjoy
representing your own brand yourself is the best way to go if you cant sell it who will midas touch
from the great author of rich dad poor dad robert kiyosaki here is a very nice article 
 make an appearance we would love to host you at the usc thanks
 mr trump for president thank you
 is the kind of president we need true
 if u r so disappointed at obama why don't u run for president in watch
 how can general dempsey tell obama delaying syria bombardment will have no consequences he's no patton
 i just love ur way of thinking and analyzing things the pointthanks
 mr trump would attack syria or no no lets make our country great again as they fight their war
the great generals macarthur and patton real leaders and fighters are spinning in their graves as we give syria info time to prepare
what i am saying is stay out of syria
for all of those fools that want to attack syria the ushas lost the vital element of surpriseso stupidcould be a disaster
 you realize that is what iran wants dont you you beat iran in a much different fashionnot through syria
 just finished 'art of the deal' brilliant insight into your mind thanks
 if two of your competitors were at war would you let them destroy each other or would you back one
 never tell your enemy when where and how you are going to hit them
 to be a champ you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will true
 soon
 thanks
congratulations to on winning tv personality of the year piers deserves his success
 's book emily gets her gun exposes the attack on our second amendment a must read
many syrian rebels are radical jihadis not our friends supporting them doesn't serve our national interest stay out of syria
 had a flawless quarterfinal win last night shes a great player and a wonderful person
 must stay focused on defunding obamacare and the impending budget battle dont let syria rule the agenda
happy new year to all of my jewish friends and supporters shana tova hopefully it will be a great year
 thanks
 thanks
with the signature services of trump attach brings premiere luxury to the white sands of waikiki 
to keep momentum keep challenging yourself think big
ive always defended but he never defends me he's not a loyal person i now understand why everybody dumped him jay sucks
i hear this moron said nasty things about me hair etcboring on the terminated show stupid guybad ratings
appreciate your property and your property will appreciate for you think like a billionaire
 you have more followers than they do so true and am hopefully much smarter
 you need to go on to bash jay leno howard hates him too howard is right on lenojay is over
 just turned off jay i can't watch him anymore running out with the phony high fiveshe's lost it
 u mad because doesn't want u on his show he begs me to go on his showdone it many times loser
 send it to me in new york doug thanks
 i wish i could go on jay's show so badly real quote from real quote is i wish they would stop calling
jay leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show my answer is always no because his show sucks they love my ratings
is anthony weiner a jerk or what
 why do you think you're so polarizing because i like to beit often times brings out the truth
 do u like lettermans show yes much smarter than leno
 when is gonna pay you that is a very good question his only good song is donald trump

 inspires me soo much great
 very true
 think its time for the donald to make a surprise visit to speak to vince
 thank you
 hell yeah dammit i love the frankness and brutal honesty of it is the only way
 you would make such a good president thank you
 haha i love how you just tell like it is you aren't who you are by not doing just that
president obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about syria crossing the red line amazingly now he denies he said that
the only reason president obama wants to attack syria is to save face over his very dumb red line statement do not attack syriafix usa
 haha i love how you just tell like it is you aren't who you are by not doing just that thank you
 god your the best mr trump i like you tooooo
tell congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world make america great again
if you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the ny times of the rebels executing prisoners you would say forget the rebels
while everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack syria maybe we should knock the hell out of iran and their nuclear capabilities
 have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the syrian soldiers heart liver
again to our very foolish leader do not attack syria if you do many very bad things will happen from that fight the us gets nothing
i have just lost my beautiful elegant long time exec assistant norma foerderer she passed away yesterday a truly magnificent woman
it will be interesting to see what happens to eliot spitzer if he loses the election for comptroller to very capable 
that would mean that eliot spitzer has failed at everything he's donepolitics tv even real cont 
if president obama was going to attack syria he shouldve done it a long time ago as a surprise not after cont 
must read via by congress should vote no on syria 
all former bush administration officials should have zero standing on syria iraq was a waste of blood treasure
a mph gust of wind wrecked a wind turbine in scotland any turbine in close proximity to a school must go
russia is sending a fleet of ships to the mediterranean obamas war in syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict
in january ' turbines were wrecked in rough weather 
 while a ft turbine in ardrossan north ayrshire erupted in flames the previous month during gales of mph 
if you plan for the worst if you can live with the worst the good will always take care of itself the art of the deal
we should not attack syria but if they make the stupid move to do so the arab leaguewhose members are laughing at us should pay
 you're a pussy shut up and stop crying show is funny no jay is dumb as a rockgets outplayed
the terrorists in syria are calling themselves rebels and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid
 why is sierra club not speaking up for the birds slain by turbines must read from biologist 
 in this case what would you do if you were the president i'd rebuild the us and make it great again
 i wish you'd run for office the country needs more minds like yours thank you
 trump for president thanks
 well quit yapping about and run for office i like your ideas do it
did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our president explaining what when and where to congress about a syrian attack far too late
we don't have the leadership including the generals who just said the element of surprise does not matter to attack anyone cool it
really bad news just announced concerning jobs far fewer jobs created in august than anticipated interest rates therefore to remain low
i wonder how much our leaders have promised or given russia in order for them to behave and not make the us look even worse
i am not angry at russia or china because their leaders are far smarter than ours we need real leadership and fastbefore it is too late
 it's sad that knows more about politics than our politicians
remember the golden rule of negotiating he who has the gold makes the rules midas touch
the historic m renovations at are moving on pace once complete will be south floridas premiere resort
no surprise woman being cited by kerry mccain on syrian rebels is a paid consultant of the rebels 
via by hannah sampson blt prime coming to trumps doral resort 
many of the syrian rebels are radical jihadi islamists who are murdering christians why would we ever fight with them
obama is not a leader he's just a campaigner
do you want to know who you are don't ask act action will delineate and define you thomas jefferson
any political leader who wont face the future head on is putting the american dream at risk the america we deserve
 we should send obama and congress to syria
when we have big disasters no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping but we are always expected to come to the aid of others
if syria was forced to use obamacare they would selfdestruct without a shot being fired obama should sell them that idea
 huntingtons disease is a terminal and genetic illnessplease retweet for education
 thx rt well done thurs cable news ratings fox's bret baier beats cnn msnbc hln combined
just watching nbc news where our potential attack is being detailedthe exact ships the stealth bombers the destinationsso ridiculous
syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas a polititian's war
former president jimmy carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst president in the history of the united states
i'm a republican but not a fan of the last george bushhe also was a lousy president iraq etc in fact he was so bad he gave us obama
 if only japan had the same courtesy dec they should have told us they were coming like us with syria
 you need to make a run time will tell
 could you imagine bill belichek broadcasting to tom coughlin exactly when and where he was going to blitz
 thank you but we are dealing with many very stupid people
speaking of our very stupid war with iraq it is totally disintegrating and iran with russia will walk in and take it over lots of oil
 saw on a video in history yesterday made my day thanks very nice
 i'm addicted to your books are you writing another any time soon at some point there is so much to write
 can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game actually yes
isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks president obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there
president obama do not attack syria there is no upside and tremendous downside save your powder for another and more important day
 trump will do or say anything but toure why only one name is just a very dumb racistbad ratings

 dumb as a rock toure doesn't have a clue about money or anything elsemerely a simpleton racistreally bad ratingsreally stupid guy
 mr trump how is toure a racist i just don't see it not enough people watch him to know
icahn kravis zell buffett have all used the bankrutcy law to their benefit many of the top business people do
 why does always insist on calling ppl names and trying to taunt like a kid in a schoolyard only stupid people
 why does a network allow a stupid racist like toure to stay on the air when his ratings are so abysmal can there be only one reason
 lol way to go trumpbrilliant and funny double threat guy
 just curious toure how have you done with your business ventures and how many people do you employ
 he is not smart enough to understand
do you believe what is going on in washington with respect to syria these people don't have a clue
 personally i would ignore toure everybody else does he is not relevant you are i don't like dumb racists
 would you lend him of people wouldn't no he's too stupidlost 's
 how old were you when you decided what you wanted to do with your life 
 syria is a complex and dynamic situation no one would expect you to comprehend it nor obama so true

the russians are playing a very smart game in the meantime they are buying lots of time for syria and making us look foolish dangerous
 you are a great american thanks from a vietnam vet
this new russian strategy guarantees victory for the syrian governmentand makes obama and us look hopelessly bad president in trouble
red line statement was a disaster for president obama
 you want to send more americans out to war why don't you sign up i am against an attack on syria dummy
 putin is much smarter than obama no surprise his tactics
 the bama presidency has been a disaster for america
 you will knock the president anyway wrong i would love to see him do a great job but it's not working that way
 everything you say is true and i respect you because your not afraid to say it
 the birth certificate that you forced obama to show is a computer generated forgery
 putin is making o and kerry look like chumps
 full supporter of thanks
 he has kept his campaign pledge to fundamentally transform americafor the worse
 i honestly think our next president should be people can say what they want but dude seems to have it
will be covering president obama's speech at on twitteryou are all so lucky
here we go
does he look sharp smart and presidentialhis hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noisemicrophone too sensitive
making his case in a nice and articulate manner
doesn't want to remove assad worries what comes next
 why wasn't obama more concerned wbenghazi killed syria not our business
he is working hard and for that he must be given credit
we will have to see what russia's next move will be they may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess
bottom line i don't think president changed people's minds must hope for a lifeline from putin a very dangerous lifeline at that
wow eliot spitzer has lost great news for new york city
 give credit where it is due nyc voters chose correctly
 what will you miss most about wiener absolutely nothing
i fought hard against spitzer and weiner and both lost for a while when spitzer was way up it seemed that i was a lone voice good power
thank you to all of my twitter followers for helping to defeat weiner and spitzer remember in the beginning they said it couldn't be done
 i remember when schneiderman was nd in command to patterson on the d side can you believe those two
 youre welcome we did it thank you to all of my twitter followers for helping to defeat weiner and spit
 a big key to winning is knowing where the other side is coming from think like a champion
 in donald we trust thanks

 i love love donald trump thanks
lightweight ag eric schneiderman asked us for political contributions during his investigation of usthen sued for milliondopey guy
lightweight attorney general eric schneiderman will be next to lose he goes after a school with a approval ratingleaves biggies alone
 think weiner will move to a state that doesn't know him he should move better for him to make a new start
 you are the greatest thank you i will be working hard on that
the only reason obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the scheduleputin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad
back to work for the president to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself the socalled rebels must be thoroughly confused
assad hit the jackpot
weiner is gone spitzer is gone next will be lightweight ag eric schneiderman is he a crook wait and see worse than spitzer or weiner
 i worked for another self made man elon musk i have the greatest respect for both of you thank you
 who should be the ag replacement any thoughts there are a number of very good people
 your passion for entertainment biz is so great that it bought you a name recognition outside business field
 is on a roll and its only a my time i love his enthusiasm if only everyone had his thought process
 my husband and i think you're so awesome we can't wait to come to nyc one day and see the trump towers great
 he must go people like him r destroying our country and our principals re lightweight ag schneiderman
spitzer and weiner lost lightweight eric schneiderman will be next he will be challenged in the primary he has done a really poor job
i said that eliot spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls i fought him when others retreated out of fear never give up
putin is having such a good time our president is making him look like the genius of all geniuses do not fearwe are a nation of potential
obama must now start focusing on our country jobs healthcare and all of our many problems forget syria and make america great again
 thank you for saving new york from another spitzer era we got lucky

our country is being run by total amateurs lets just call it amateur hour
 s sales are so dismal that w its record losses it is going biweekly should end pain just fold
i love watching the dishonest writers suffer the magazines failure
no surprise saudis turned down spot on un security council they dont want responsibility just have us do their heavy lifting
wow china's growth accelerated in third quarter if the us had half that number we would be the talk of the world need leadership
canadians kicked out the firm that the us paid all that money to for the failed website how stupid are our leaders this is a scandal
 a terrible statement like that shows how desperate you and your magazine are you should be ashamed
no wonder is doing so poorly with an idiot sr editor like it will only get worse
 i wish the would be president our country would be much better off than what it is 
i hope everyone that read 's reprehensible statement will cancel their subscription to in protest let me know
 whats wrong with canadians nothing except they are too smart for us leaders to deal with
 does anyone read anymore i'm sure it'll be sold for a dollar just like newsweek
 never had the stinking nymag but if i did i would cancel for the trump it's dead anyway
 i will never subscribe just for you your beautiful family donald it's boring

i wonder what the late great vince lombardi would say about the rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled

i wonder if the rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming
 donald we can't allow this country to become soft like obama and penn state please run in 
the wimps that run penn state should be forced to resign and be sued for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
maybe some of the dead voters who helped get president obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for obamacare
how did the ncaa which is weak and becoming irrelevant extract such a big reputation shattering settlement from penn state others zero

 best moments at the oscars harrison ford seeking pizza and on twitter
 the best ending to the would have been saying you're fired
 donald trump was the best part of the 
 your tweets made my night
ellen was so awkward and insecure last night the pizza skit was terrible she should dump andy lassner a guy with no absolutely no talent

we're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly chinese passengers and that's okbut how much are russia china spending
i don't hate obama at all i just think he is an absolutely terrible president maybe the worst in our history
while putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the world president obama is watching march madness basketball

great advice from my father know everything you can about what you're doing fred c trump
great advice from my mother trust in god and be true to yourself mary macleod trump
putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers sad
i believe putin will continue to rebuild the russian empire he has zero respect for obama or the us
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever must be very strong to prosper survive
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to world war iii we need great leadership fast
obama must now focus get his mind off marchmadness and lead watch russia closely work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone i hear they will be doing it soonlong overdue

robert slater who just passed away was a terrific writer who wrote a very fair book about me he will be missed 
he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else benjamin franklin
president obama looks absolutely exhausted in the netherlands he is not a natural leader was never ment to lead it is tough work for him
not good or smart for obama to be calling russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in nyc
this is the time for the united states to be strengthening all important military components not rolling over and dealing from weakness
 watched his speech yesterdaypathetic carteresque weak his delivery is so cautious not to offend absolutely zero true
by obama mentioning manhattan yesterday in his response he has singlehandedly made it target how totally stupid is this guy
if youve looked over the yearsive been right on virtually every issue from iraq not going in but if so taking the oil to jobs to china

president obama created a very bad precedent by handing over five taliban prisoners in exchange for sgt bowe bergdahl another us loss
 run for president we need a leader not a politician so true
the us cannot negotiate with terrorists it is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved but this can only lead to disaster
 now the enemy knows that capturing soldiers is worth it bc our idiot president will give them what they want
 just watched your speech at the national press club fantastic as usual please consider we need fantastic leadership
 wonder how long it takes the released terrorists to attack americans
 when the released prisoners kill americans what does obama say to their parents
 trump we need someone who not only wants to change this country but can change this country thanks
 run in for the sake of future generations obama and his friends are tearing america apart
 not long obama plays with our emotion's knowing we all love to see this soldier come home stupid man
 please run for president to save america my whole family is knows youre the only man who can do it true
at some point sgt bergdahl will have to explain his capture in he simply wandered off his base without a weapon many questions
 if you don't run in i'm moving to canada please help us mr trump don't move so fast
 you need to run for president like right now mister trump
the statement about leaving the base came directly from cbs evening news
 watching your cspan special from the other day i can't get enough of it thank you
 watching what you said on tuesday on you make sense i hope to continue to learn from you thank you sir
 donald please run
 for president time for a change in the right direction
 a successful bid would restore american exceptionalism entrepreneurship and leadership
 president trump would have america walking proudly talking loudly carrying big stick n foreign policy again 
 trump ur biid prez n would make us top economic superpower encourage r allies slow or stop r enemies 
 so yeah the first vote i will ever cast for president will be donald trump bc who can really argue with donald trump
 i refuse to vote for anybody but trump in the next presidential election he is the only man that can lead this corrupted country
 how many people would vote for donaldtrump if he ran i would if you can make in new york you can make it anywhere 
 your ties are amazing thanks
 trump boldy calls out problemsthen offers solutions opinions that excite the electorate just like reagan
 my econ teacher says ur the only one who can fix the economy if you run my whole school will vote for you
 i'm not sayingtrump should necessarily be a term president give him years and he can begin the restructuring of our economy
 running the us is much like running a business who better at that than the donald 
 we need you you are the answer to this nations problems 
 you are an inspiration to me and my friends 
 the tower is crazy absolutely in love 
 if you runit will be the first time i vote
 i hope runs for ratings for debate nights would blow right out of the water
 donald for president thanks

 that wouldn't be hard to do true

 i like but i just love just great men thanks
 looking forward seeing on tonight has my vote as the next thanks
 if you run as donald trump and not a democrat or republican the people will vote for you
 enjoyed seeing you on you should run for president you would get this great country going again
that the obama administration didn't know the facts about who bergdahl was before making the stupid killers for one trade is pathetic
only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for bergdahl 
bowe bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to solders died looking for him us should never have made the deal punishment
 who knew al qaeda had such good negotiators impressive for against the mighty usa 
 obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world we are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions
great deal we swap killer terrorists for a us military deserter thats how the us negotiates nowadays
president said we would never leave a soldier behind how about the who died in benghazi
because of our terrible leaders it is now open season on every american throughout the world terrorists are thrilled
be sure to buy this months magazine read a trump card my interview with jeffrey lord
obamas war on coal is killing american jobs making us more energy dependent on our enemies creating a great business disadvantage

 i want you mr trump as the president well we'd better get someone fastthe us is going downfast
moving forward ftonights competitive primaries it is crucial that the tea party remain united towards november take the senate
it would be nice if our commanderinchief was as concerned for our veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens
the problem is that no government can create real jobs only entrepreneurs can do that midas touch
remember our six brave heroes who died searching for bergdahl after he deserted ht 
the entrepreneurs ability to dream to win lose and win again and again is often called the entrepreneurial spirit midas touch
our president is a great embarrassment to the us how could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid for swap
the five taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now they are saying how dumb us is
 what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate donald trump
rapidly failing magazine hits me for my strong stance against obama's brilliant killers for deserter trade amazing
 if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure stop instead make your work more pleasurable donald trump
 thank you for a great and very accurate story well done
was susan rice told to lie about bergdahl obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything from obamacare to a deserter
are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence
obama never consulted with congress about a prisoner exchange he broke the law and should be tried our president is a total disaster
chris mcdaniel looks like he will win in mississippi great news and big victory for tea party
if you like to work hard you will attract people with the same ethic think like a billionaire
 i think he deals prisoners the same way he deals money true
i hope we never find life on other planets because there's no doubt that the us government will start sending them money

amazing view of 
i believe that in addition to the terrorist leaders president obama gave up for bergdahl a great deal of cash was also given so stupid
 he got the president to show his birth certificate he has clout my friend he can really stir things up
 obama can strike a deal with the taliban but can't make a deal with congress
 call it any way you like but snowden is a traitor when our country was great do you know what we did to traitors 
 i always tell people to vote for donald trump if he runs for president he knows the real deal

 are you running for president watch
 its embarrassing yet no one seems to know how to turn our country around a bunch of clueless leaders true
 would you be aggressive as president not aggressive smart
 in my first presidential election that i can vote in i would vote for great
the same brilliant negotiators that gave up five taliban leaders for one traitor are now making trade deals with china othersno chance
remember the terrible for trade whereby the taliban got back leaders killers and we got back a nothing will come back to haunt us
 i would vote for trump we need discipline intelligence and most of all strength he would bring all 
no president in history has lied to the american people more than president obama in fact it is not even close
 it should be you negotiating you know how to read ppl before they say or do anything for president
 how about bush he lied about iraq and wmd's cost us lives i agree i think he was also a terrible president
 if you were in washington this country would be in better shape wow thank you for caring so much
 trump for president you would make a difference i think you're great thank you
 if ran for president in i'd totally vote for himwe need a business man to get the economy back on track
the miss usa pageant will be amazing tonight to be politically incorrect the girls women are really beautiful nbc at pm

iran is moving troops into iraq under the guise that it is helping out actually they will take over iraq and all of their oil stupid us
turnberry in scotland is a far superior golf course to pinehurst and it isn't even close likewise the blue monster at doral
iran will convince our incompetent president that they are trying to help us with iraq take over the country oil and o will say thanks
i have been very consistent and always said that iraq would fall as soon as the us left what a terrible waste of lives and money

 have you ever seen trump nationalbedminster or trump international golf links in scotland both far better than pinehurst

 never in the history of televised golf has a course looked so bad and unattractive a dry burnt out mess bad for golf
 big news from scotland on turnberry which by the way blows pinehurst away tomorrow morning stay tuned
 couldn't agree more the course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would boring finish
 i thought this was the us open not the wanna be british open
 it's worse for i know i wouldn't pay to play what looks like a neglected municipal course
 worked for yrs got fired because they didn't think i could keep up no severance would u do that no way
 just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass you gave him a rewardgood job donald thanks
 he has a point fairways should be green scruff can be as bad as you want wouldn't pay top dollar
i'd bet the horrible look of pinehurst translates into poor television ratings this is not what golf is about
 they think the course should be old school you know like before lawn care technology aka goats
 please don't let the usga ruin your course in like they did pinehurst i won't
 look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg true
 very subdue atmosphere not take it away from kaymer but it's like watching paint dry 
johnny miller correctly very critical of greens at pinehurst said they should be redone
 my position on pinehurst is correct bad for the game a dried out cow pasture you have no clue but keep trying
 i have watched open championships at turnberry one of the great golf courses of the world pinehurst not in the same league
 matt you don't understand golf even though you think you doi have numerous couses that are far superior to pinehurst
 i've played pinehurst and trump bedminster and donald has in bedminister that are superior thank you true
 sir donald rather than promote golf courses please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our country
 i agree with the donald what a goat track i'll take the beauty of pebble any day
 i've played the new doral which is awesomeone day i hope to play another trump course
 future british open 
 i completely agree with dt here pinehurst looks bad i wouldn't pay to play if it looked like that
 actually agreeit may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on tvi love golfcouldn't watch
 matt you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful you are all talk no substance
 is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with i can beat him in golf even easier
 big time i love trump bedminster
 played trump bedminster oncewill never forget it
 are the commercials filmed at trump national la yes
 stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions donaldtrump is times more successful than you
 matt how many club championships have you won i hear zero or fewer than me lets play for a lot
 you have made some great courses but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course i agree
 it was nice of you to give minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had i agree
 i concur with on pinehurst imo those blasts from sandy areas looked like ieds exploding in kandahar province
 course didn't look good in hd just saying no it looked terrible bad for golf
congratulations to martin kaymer for winning the great playing from beginning to end

the us must immediately stop all flights from ebola infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our borders act fast
the fact that we are taking the ebola patients while others from the area are fleeing to the united states is absolutely crazystupid pols
 i find and his tweets thoroughly entertaining
 looking forward to my work week in and my favorite rooftop restaurant best view 
 they knew the risk when they went to africa they choose it freely

middle eastern countries must participate militarily no running away and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them
tell saudi arabia and others that we want demand free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private boeing spay up
 obama's mind isis ebola etc and then thinking boy i wish i was on the golf coarse what should i wear on the links
 donald in the house you nailed it down
 they should pay us free oil for the next years
 great questionagreed
 you are right enough is enough
 saudi arabia is already paying isis
 so true they should pay up for our protection and by the way stop persecuting christians over there too
 that's right we aided in their wealth and their silence on this matter demonstrates their acceptance
 great point freedom is not free and the american people are tired of paying for it it's time for other nations to pay up
 saudi arabia are nothing but mouth pieces bullies cowards they have the money but no guts
 the american public will fall deeper in debt and will crush our middle class another plan of our socialistic president

 you're the best can't imagine where you find the time thank you
 who does geraldo think he is the worlds most famous man he's driving me insane 
 geraldo needs to shut tf up 
 is perfect for the commercial awesome 
 geraldo is a princess please get over yourself 
 genius idea having geraldo on this season perfection
 your behavior is awful you need to dial down the arrogance
 holy shit amazing 
 kate's brain the lights are on and no ones home 
 thnx u for ur support 
 did you know before the show how immature and confrontational geraldo was
 geraldo is being a high maintenance diva
 what a baby he's having a temper tantrum because he isn't getting his own way
 boardroom is going to get ugly
 guys should have won i don't disagree but executives picked
 geraldo looks happy they lost bc he wasn't project manager 
 brandi should win i hope kate and geraldo get kicked off soon
remember after this new episode starts minutes
 the boardroom is jaw dropping
 great episode of celebrity apprentice 
 well the donald already knows who is going kevin i feel for you 
 i can't decide if geraldo's ego is a gimmick a plant by trump or if it's for real 
 is acting like a spoiled little brat 
 geraldo rivera the hispanic omarosa
 i'm way to addicted to watching celebrity apprentice 
 celebrity apprentice is back i love who is going to be the of the season 
 love the show
 this season of the is off to a great start
 how does everyone not like watching show 
 he just knows how to ask the right questions to get the celebs to turn on each other which i find funny
 making it happen
 loveee 
 i don't like why is she even on i wish could answer this for me
 this show is gold 
 love 's dress 
 i like trump tower 
 apprentice is so good this season i'd like to thank for these back to back episodes this show amazing
 is my hero have never had so much fun watching 
 currently stirs the pot lmao 
 well damn got straight to the point didn't ya 
 was gilbert good cough cough cough
 donaldtrump it's has to be so hard to keep personal feelings out of the boardroom love how you call the bs 
 i love the way you don't take any crap from i can't wait to hear you say kate you're fired
 you're awesome in that boardroom great back to back episodes tonight
 please fire she's rude and classless 
 way to go shawn johnson
 the women rule tonight on let's hope they don't kill each other before next week 
 i like the bachelor but is getting all the love on mondays best of 
 no gilbert wasn't good he cant be focused on the product more interested in a laugh
 shawn was absolutely right bringing up the why was trashy imho very trashy 
 can just fire kate gosselin just because 
 way to go shawn johnson 
 is so intimidating i would never wanna be on his bad side he's still basically a king tho
 i'm so glad shawn stood up for herself
 is the male version of from years ago 
 join the lean scene with you exercise and a heathy trio agreed wtwo u fired tonight
 omg the funniest this has just been the best season so far 
 it definitely is in this household great job sir
 he should have fired vivicia right away she's trash
 just completed the art of the deal written the year i was born and its principles still apply today very inspiring
 donald it's time to boot kate 
 she truly is well spoken gracious
 a great night of watching thank you mr 
 i'm loving as project manager 
 geraldo is an egotistical selfcentered pain strong competitor makes for a good show 
 great show better than the wwe lol

jonah goldberg of the once great review is truly dumb as a rock why does put this dummy on his show
 sorry there was only one breakout star this weekend in new hampshire just check out the local new hampshire media
national review may be going out of business because of the really pathetic job being done by no talent means death sad
 it's pathetic for to bash as nonserious talkers bashing a successful doer
 it has cratered since wfb passed away so true wfb is spinning in his grave jonah killed it

 trouble in paradise for clintons 
when you can't make them see the light make them feel the heat ronald reagan
 you stated that i started relentlessly tweeting like a yearold girl horrible insult to women resign now or later
people have been forced to resign positions for far less than s tweeting like a year old girl
with a stupid guy like jonah goldberg who uses tweeting like a year old girl to hit me no wonder the nro is doing so poorly 
im a conservative but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other whereas liberals unite to win
the reason ed schultz said nice things about me is that im the only repub who won't cut social security etc ill make america rich again
 donald trump would be the greatest president thank you
 u would make a damn good one
 dear you are the most admired man in the world and everybody hopes you run for president

wow policemen hurt in baltimore some badly where is the national guard police must get tough and fast thugs must be stopped
blatant and rampant property destruction in baltimore as the police stand by and watch should be a lesson on how not to handle riots sad
our great african american president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore
now that the ineffective baltimore police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the us taxpayers expected to rebuild it again
the mayor of baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy another real genius
 can we drop off in the middle of so he can show obama how it's done i would fix it fast
our country has to come together we have to start working with and really liking each other the whole world is watching baltimore
president obama you have a big job to do go to baltimore and bring both sides together with proper leadership it can be done do it
the best social program by far is a job our jobs are being taken away from us by china and many other countries incompetent leader
hopefully there won't be any problems in baltimore tonight be calm be cooldo not let anybody get hurtthere is just too much to live for
i wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the united states as they watch the disgusting and out of control baltimore riots

 i have loved you since wrestlemania when i was kid i grew up see what you're all about i am behind you all the way

univision wants to back out of signed contract because i exposed the terrible trade deals that the us makes with mexico
i love mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the us so stupidly makes with them really bad for us jobs only good for mexico
once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down jeb pushed him hard remember
anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the us should boycott 
 cares far more about mexico than it does about the us are they controlled by the mexican government
if i win the presidency my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike bush's appointee john roberts on obamacare

 listen to what he says you will know in your heart it is the truth we are in a bad way he is the only one who gets it
 is our only hope 
 if what everyone says is true trump will score huge if this is for publicity i'd trust trump
 like him or not says exactly what he thinks and doesn't beat around the bush and that's admirable

trump however would kick his ass

now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the us comes over border
but that's what i've been saying very unfair treatment by the media
 why people support thank you
the us will invite el chapo the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a us citizen because our leaders can't say no
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the us
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border we get the killers drugs crime they get the money
when will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement mexico is sending which turned out to be true el chapo

i am now in iowa getting ready to speak people are always amazed to find out that i am protestant presbyterian great
statement on john mccain 
just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon
in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president
captured or not all our soldiers are heroes
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives
all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything
i will make this right for our great vets
it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept
congrats to the new gov of texas for taking a tough bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by perry
why would anybody listen to he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mccain
via donald trump john mccain is a loser 
one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly
wow just wrote the definitive piece on what i said about john mccain 
 because she shoots straight like you do mr trump no bullsht just truth '
 i'm on the 
 kick there ass trump
 mr trump the only one telling the truth liberals can't stand the fact that your are leading in the poll
 why do they attack mr trump because he has something they dont the ability of truth trump is here
john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk
a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterday 
the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times
i will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy make america great again
my piece trump i don't need to be lectured 
 mccain epitomizes the career politicians who have gotten us into our trillion trainwreck including the va debacle
 they can't handle you donald so want you out the race well good luckbecause we know you won't walk away give it to them
 the left wing politically correct cannot handle big don giving the truthrealitykeep saying it like it is 
 bravo for saying whats on most of americans mind lets make america great again
 rn for yrs veterans have less benefits than medicaid recipients thnx for speaking 
 that's all the career politicians do is talk
 trump for president 
 gotta love the honesty
 voters like tough and smart that's why we are voting trump 
 what do you say now 
 we love you trump trump for president 
 keep it up donald america needs a winner not a whiner
 will make the best president ever
 you have the guts and backbone this country politics has needed for years 
 the truth hurts sometimes who careskeep telling it like it is
 rt my piece trump i don't need to be lectured 
 trump is the only person we believe will actually set things right
 glad u r man enough speak the truth in this pathetic politically correct world
the ever dwindling which is worth about of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically who cares
we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans
 at least we're talking about the we weren't a month ago 
 this is big criticism of the republican field speak truth and stop being so pc this is why resonates
 hosts events around the our long before a presidential run he loves our military
 i believe we have passed that point there are homeless veterans in usa yet illegal aliens get government housing
 trump says things that no one else would even consider saying i agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty
 trump already hosts vets at his resorts what does hillary do
 the left is petrified of you why else would they be attacking you so vigorously
 rest of gop only cries but trump gets stuff done
 i agree mccain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our vets
it was only after i informed nbc that i wouldn't do the apprentice that they became upset w me they couldnt care less about inclusion
this story is no longer about john mccain its about our horribly treated vets illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans
look how small the pages have become looks like a tabloidsaving money i assume
i will be interviewed on tonight at will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc
 great interview give trump a hot mic and watch out it is the rawness the nonpc guy 
 i'll watch anything that gives you a chance to share your views go donald

alabama was great last night amazing people folks was largest crowd of political season nice
 that chant gave me sweet sweet chills 
 keep talking donaldthe people want to hear it loud and clear
 covers me more inaccurately than any other media source and that is saying something they go out of their way to distort truth
i had people in phoenix but said the rooms capacity is just over but said bernie sanders had in same room
thank you to the for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in alabama last night it was a great evening
how is bernie sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone very sad
it has just been confirmed by the city of mobile alabama that there were people at last nights event making it pol season
now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally speaking up just politicians
jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing
jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body jeb just can't get it right
the last thing we need is another bush in the white house would be the same old thing remember read my lips no more taxes greatness
new reuters poll just came out and has me at highest number yetthe silent majority is back and we will make america great again
as i have long stated we are so tied in with china and asia that their markets are now taking the us market down get smart usa

 ordered my trump banner today can't wait
 so true jeb bush is crazy who cares that he speaks mexican this is america english 
 kelly file was much better without megyn kelly her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better
jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc is he ashamed of the name bush a pretty sad situation go jeb
in a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed asians
asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics a mess
jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence it's not a fence jeb it's a wall and there's a big difference
 did a terrible job as governor of new york if he ran again he would have lost in a landslide he and graham zero in polls
 no hope for jeb bush anymore has been on fire really hope he can get the win and fix this country
 gov scott walker has ran wisconsin's economy into the ground how dare he criticize you you would fire him in a second
 i lived in ny when tacky pataki was gov he was a total disaster for the people of new york

get rid of all of these commercials 
 if i have the on cnn but pay attention more to my phone does it still count as me watching it
 good luck commenting on this snooze fest i'm out
 webb is out bad opening 
 imagine chafey standing up to putin
the trade deal is a disaster she was always for it 
 was right is boring these ppl are so scripted so far
 make america great again would not even watch dem debate except donald is tweeting about it
can anyone imagine chafee as president no way
o'malley as former mayor of baltimore has very little chance
 i miss 
 if you got rid of commercials you would have nothing worth watching
 why do we have to be tortured by watching these clowns have the election tomorrow 
 these cats are like bad used car salesmen

 webb is trying to be and its not working he is not doing well
 i joined twitter tonight just to hear mrtrump tweet about this silly debate
 yada yadait's a bore fest best part of this is trumps tweets thanks
 i couldn't even imagine the bloodbath that would ensue if the debated any one of these five jabronis
all are very scripted and rehearsed two at least should not be on the stage
the hardest thing clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including iraq vote emails etc
good move by bernie s
sorry there is no star on the stage tonight
 i want a president who believes all lives matter and that is why we need 
 why did hillary get to skate past the do black lives matter anderson let her off hook
 how amazing is it that the trending topic is talking about the more than the debate itself
 isn't on the stage turning this garbage off
 the only winner of the is this is not a great debate a little sad
 i can't wait for to debate one of these clowns all are so weak
sanders said only black lives matter wow hillary did not answer question
notice that illegal immigrants will be given obamacare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our veterans

the should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party

megyn kelly has two really dumb puppets chris stirewalt marc threaten a bushy who do exactly what she says all polls say i won debates
 such a played out segment as well can't stand to watch her anymore the bobbing head drives me nuts 
 is a failed bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback a third rate talent
every poll time drudge slate and others said i won both debates but heard megyn kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff i don't watch
 donald megyn kelly seeks ratings not truth not much of a journalist stay focused make your own narrative it's working
 did you also hear megyn say carson is the frontrunner according so some polls tied in other polls outright lie hatred
 karl rove still thinks romney won why is he still on tv

jeb bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them also rubio is hitting him hard
this morning chris wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because i'm on it kidding have fun
jeb why did your brother attack and destabalize the middle east by attacking iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction bad info
 loving interview thank you
 can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because i have been openly hard on his terrible choke loss to obama
 and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost
does everyone remember and his famous remarks about selfdeportation and he was done i don't need his angry advice
 just admitted donaldtrump will probably be the republican nominee 
 is what we need to fix this mess im only but my parents are voting for trump
 of course they're going up trump is going to win this thanks
 chris wallace after my interview and listening to his answers i think donald trump could be president
 joe have u resigned to the inevitable take ur seat on the 
 one of the best interviews i have seen 
 i never thought i'd say this but sparking a critical conversation on reality that bush didn't keep us safe
i should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that penn hand delivered to me minds would be changed very fast

 george is full of crap sc element tv's are chinese made what a liar

 why does fox even talk to will he is clueless and doesn't represent what our party is about

dopey who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and picks said last week on that biden was in

after a great evening and packed auditorium in iowa i am now in colorado looking forward to what i am sure will be a very unfair debate
 continues to report fictious poll numbers number one based on every statistic is trump by a wide margin they just can't say it
 can you believe kasie hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in iowa is a scam
 i watched the entire rally and trump was very well received the place was packed
does anybody think that will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate sad
 is trying to drive down poll numbers to install carson who the establishment gop will promptly roll win don win
 get your polls straight trump is going to win he is the only one tough enough to run this country
 the liberals are terrified that you'll be the one to go against hillary
 why only donald trump can beat hillary 
i'm sure the media will not report the highly respected new national poll that just came out via the economist 
 poll one of the most highly respected was just released wow wait until the media digests these numbers won't be happy

further proof that gang of eight member marco rubio is weak on illegal immigration is paul singer's mr amnesty endorsementrubs can't win
anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for marco rubio read this 
jeb's new slogan jeb can fix it i never thought of jeb as a crook stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics
i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor
marco rubio will not win weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight
if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate bad facts for marco if properly delivered
join me tuesday nov rd at pm in in nyc i'll be signing copies of my book crippled america don't miss it
while in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear that hillary does not want to run against trump

 trump is our last chance to turn this country around 
 read all about the wollman deal and many other successful deals in the art of the deal by 
 great interview ranks just above the interview
 nope trump isn't taking weeks off to promote his book trump is donating all to charity
 rubio is irresponsible on finances and doesn't show up for work who would hire him not the american people
 this interview is great
i will be interviewed on at am and at talking about my new book out today crippled america
 breaking latest poll of florida voters shows enormous lead for trump he'd beat hillary 
join me today nov rd in at noon i'll be signing copies of my new book crippled america don't miss it

 i trust 's polls they are actually really fair and really balanced on all their news iowa lead
 is looking for a new puppet after governor walker and jeb bush cratered he now likes rubionext fail
 your performances in every state have been amazing 
 trump is the only one who can make america great again carson's sleepy jeb low energy
 the polls are for the news cycle trump is miles ahead and leaving all others in the dust don't doubt me
marco rubio would keep barack obamas executive order on amnesty intact see article cannot be president 
i will be on tonight at pme talking about my new book and much more 
 donald trump full interview fox and friends 
 rubio wants common core for education
 he is a common sense powerhouse that gets things done excellent book 
 this says it all trump 
 we finally have a voice with lets do our part vote in the primary 
 the complete interview getting things done via 
 sarah palin defends donald trump's immigration plan on fox news via 
 shooting promos for with cecily and 
 i can't wait to read your new book we are supporting you here in boise idaho
 on sending special ops forces troops to syria this country needs to be less predictable
 reading crippled america feeling love for our country first in it's pages that's why i stand with trump
 republicans in congress can learn a lot from on dealing with obama they should read 
 crippled america is a must read so right great job on another best seller
 donald trumpcrippled america the new book by is best seller in the making
 just read great book i haven't felt this enthusiastic about since 
 every single real american needs to read beyond awesome i couldn't be more thrilled
 twittercomfujgynsk
isn't it terrible that used a poll not used before ibd when i was down but refuses to use it now when i am up
wow poll just came out with almost as importantly i am the strongest on economic issues by far 
i will unveil my first campaign ads on at am tomorrow enjoy 
also tune in to the at am i will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and 
jeb bush just said about marco rubio he's my friend pure political speak why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend
 carson has the worst health plan ever re soc sec and medicare he wants to abolish medicare no way
 why didn't correct jeb when he said has run president x bjeb needs b corrected bc he lied
 what other candidate begins to rival trump in his knowledge breadth of issues stamina thanks
 i am a lifelong democrat and i will be voting trump great
 should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice never ran merely considered running
 jeb's whole campaign is fueled by lies just like his brother lied about iraq bush dynastylies
 no need everyone knows jeb is full of blank
 i just finished reading crippled america it's a detailed blueprint to get america back on track
 poll numbers are higher then most think no one is asking democrats if they are voting trump
rubio lied about my meeting w hispanic activists i didnt change my opinion but treated them w respect shame 
 msm are lying to you about hispanics hating trump here's the real deal 
the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worsetrying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend
 i love to see the respect you have shown to your parents siblings and children proven respect and class needed in usa
 trump supporters aren't angry we're smart we're men women millennials politically saavy 
 ivanka said it and you said it too you'll be great for women 
 wow you openly lie about who's ahead in the gop race trump is leading in of polls shameful 
a great honor to easily finish first in the poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner
 silent majority did not try to kill their mothers like ben carson but wants america rebuilt by only one capabletrump
 interesting presidential race carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer and beats carson in the polls
 it's about time we find a republican that can take on the democrats 
 marco rubio can't even handle his own credit card how is he going to be able to handle the us finances 
 huge lead in reuters national poll 
 rubio is a manchurian candidate people will own him if he ever became president
florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card sure
such bad reporting a puff piece on ben carson in the states that carson is trying to solidify his lead but i am easily sad
with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it
carson now admits his friend named bob who he tried to stab bob was saved by his belt buckle no longer exists as bob wrong name
i think it would be a good ideaand fairto include in the debate both solid good guys 
 thank you so much for the nice words and supportreally enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts
 all rep should stand with forget bush rubio and knife attackers 
 this is not good wow one of many lies by ben carson big story
getting ready for commercial 
 keep it comming trump people need to be warned about that carson figure who is not who they think
 how anyone could see him as president baffles me lies and insane theories
 the straw man candidate is falling apart
 and they kept rand paul on the main stage let's get huck and christie back
 super excited to watch tomorrow night on 
 great video which of these polls is suspect kudos to 
 will be highest rated show ever is a marketing genius hope it does well
 is carson hallucinating now lies about westpoint 
happy birthday to the great he's done so many wonderful things not the least of which is his fantastic family i love billy
so sad that obama rejected keystone pipeline thousands of jobs good for the environment no downside
will be on tonight signing a copy of crippled america for bill 
 only donald trump can thank you
 don't let the keystone pipeline die the us needs to be good neighbors with canada and energy independent
 has become a sad case his magazine is failing badly probably doesn't have long to go and his predictions are always wrong
would be nice if learned how to read the polls before writing his next story probably done on purpose but not good reporting
 one more day donald trump hosts with tomorrow will be a wild night
 this is why the polls are wrong i am a lifelong democrat and i will be voting trump 
one of the dumbest political pundits on television is chris stirewalt of wrong facts check fox debate rankings trump dope

marco rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration in favor of easy amnesty a lightweight choker bad for 
thank you to 's robert rorke for the really nice review of so many enjoyed it very gratifying 
 twittercomarjerjlyco
 outstanding is obvious that jr has much of his father's 'charisma' and intelligence

 it shouldn't be ignored and i doubt it will be carson will drop in polls
 man i love the where you spoke the truth about hillary we have waited so long for someone to do this

 gerardwonderful job last night as moderator of the debate i told many really smart and elegant
i will be on at pm tonight tune in
will be interviewed by tonight at pm
 rubio sat back during debate on immigration hoping no would ask him about gang of 
 this yearold woman registered to vote just to cast a ballot for trump 
 you will bring out more voters to vote for you than we've seen in any election great
 i'm not convinced that any candidate other than is committed to securing our borders 
all seven online polls including drudge and time with thousands of respondents said i won the debate said i was so so
i will be interviewed on at 
today's editorial is wrong again i know that china is not in the new tpp trade deal but would come in latter through a back door
 editorial board should review my debate statement re china and tpp and apologize china not part but will get their way in later
the editorial board is so wrong so often they got info from an incorrect story in another pub why not watch and listen to debate
when and how are the dummies at the going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me i want smart trade deals
why wouldn't the call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong no wonder it is doing poorly
we as a country either have borders or we don't if we don't have borders we don't have a country
 is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp this moron wasted million on political campaigns and lost 
why does the failing write a false editorial about me and let dummy make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper
 and dopey karl rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible tpp deal 
total fool is part of the republican establishment problem an all talk no action dummy 
wow pres candidate ben carson who is very weak on illegal immigration just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship

 carlyi did graduate from wharton and did very well who is your fact checker will you apologize
 ben carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper pathological disease i didnt say it he did apology
 i only said i was on four weeks ago with putinnever said i was in green room separate piecesgreat ratings
 had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning ben carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign
 carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope sad
great honor to be inducted into the nj boxing hall of fame last night thank you timing could not have been better 
thank you for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields should have been done long ago 
they laughed at me when i said to bomb the isis controlled oil fields now they are not laughing and doing what i said 
boy is this guy tough on me so totally biased as a reporter he should be ashamed of himself 
my prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible paris attacks may god be with you all
president obama said isil continues to shrink in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in paris he is just so bad change
we need much tougher much smarter leadership and we need it now
 you need to win for not just america but for humanity
 a tough man for a tough job in tough times gloves off game on 
 you definitely have my vote
 the world is playing everything right for trump every day his points are proven

 the best book i've read in years trump is right on every issue and has the best ideas a true economic genius
when will president obama issue the words radical islamic terrorism he can't say it and unless he will the problem will not be solved
 on isisoil fields saying it for years you should acknowledge this 
i had a great time in texas yesterday a tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people will be back soon

 donald trump says tough gun control laws in paris contributed to tragedy presidential candidate
 donald trump surges in poll among likely republican voters 
 magazine is doing really poorly it has gotten worse and worse over the years and has lost almost all of it's former allure
i have watched sloppy graydon carter fail and close spy magazine and now am watching him fail at magazine he is a total loser
glad to see that lost her championship fight last night was soundly beaten not a nice person
 you're spot on he tries b an intellectual elitistthe truth he has a low iq no imagination no creativity

so many great polls like reuters big leads everywhere new hampshire really special we will win big and make america great again
i along with almost everyone else have so little confidence in president obama he has a horrible attitudea man who is resigned to defeat
refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country who knows who they are some could be isis is our president insane
gop voters trust donald trump to keep our country safe 
what is our president doing 
one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great they have lost their way and are no longer credible
 is doing very badly i can say from experience their reporting is terrible highly inaccurate sadly they are now irrelevant
melania and i just had interview with the legendary watch this friday tonight we talk isis

great new poll 
very nice article from daily mail 
via politico trump extends lead in new hampshire poll 
 new hampshire poll 'rules gop race in new hampshire' trump rubio cruz bush carson kasich 
ben carson is being severely criticized for being incapable of understanding foreign policy be one of his top consultants not good
eight syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the us isis maybe i told you so we need a big beautiful wall
broken down political pundit who is wrong almost all of the time should be thrown off boring and totally biased
dopey a big proponent of the iraq war and other catastrophes doesnt like me very much that means i win
i skipped a speech given years ago at maralago by dopey because hes boringhe never forgot
we need new leadership fast 
everyone is now saying how right i was with illegal immigration the wall after paris theyre all on the bandwagon

the legendary barbara walters interviews melania trump and me on a special this friday night at on abc don't miss it
governor kasich whose failed campaign debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend million against me
john kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me
john kasich despite being governor of ohio is losing to me in the ohio polls pathetic
i want to do negative ads on john kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that i dont want to waste my money
watch kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun
kasich has already spent million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down people from nh are smart
i loved beating john kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last
john kasich ad guy wanted to work for me but his proposal was a rip off i said no now ripping kasich
doesnt help kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else hes almost last
john kasich fell right into president obamas trap on obamacare and the people of ohio are suffering for it shame
once john kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete total dud
john kasich was managing director of lehman brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives a total failure
a great evening in iowa thank you des moines area community college for a great forum twittercomtvrmew

 so good to see the family out with him on the campaign trail it really shows the family man that he is
the failing should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on donald trump
 i lived in new jersey at that time and witnessed all that as well
the is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control with unfunded liabilitiesbig trouble
the dopes at the bought the boston globe for billion and sold it for their great old headquartersgave it away so dumb
so since the people at the have made all bad decisions over the last decade why do people care what they write incompetent
the numbers at the are so dismal especially advertising revenue that big help will be needed fast a once great institutionsad
happy thanksgiving to all have a great day and look forward to the future we will make america great again

 that is why we don't need a politician to be the next president
 trump is winning by so much more it's near nationally they are all biased polls
 as a democrat i have to say since hillary is the frontrunner i will choose trump
 cruz doesn't do anything about illegals and refugees invading texas 
people that have read it tell me that book is terrible and boring save your money should can him no credibility

many think that the championship course at turnberry home of the duel in the sun will be the worlds best after the renovation
 trump has stamina he is working harder than any other candidate he really loves america he deserves to win
 i find myself more and more drawn to cnn for fairness regarding the fox news sunday pundits a joke
 everyone vote for and no he did not pay me for this endorsement
i did interview with chris wallace of in order to be fair he then puts on rove lane and will three trump bashers to discuss
i was disappointed that ted cruz would speak behind my back get caught and then deny it well welcome to the wonderful world of politics
 not so much fairness as it is about ratings megan kellys hate nightly of trump is turnoff for fox
 that's why after your interview i couldn't watch the panel discussion which is usually my favorite segment
 trump needs his own poll a real poll in every state these polls are so ridiculousthe media will only get worse from here
 you're the real deal for my money tedcruz just doesn't cut the mustard go trump 
 problem is i never watched you until trump started giving you interviews and ratings on cnn
 and as far as that lowinfo voter base goes i have an iq of so much for that theory 
people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems
 trump did not need acquire wealth power owes nothing to anyone candidates owe their backers

 thank you sir for caring for the people of america i was in newmarket nh office 
 donald trump supporter go trump make america great again
 this suggests that online polls are more reliable so trump is crushing both parties 
 a great patriot
weak and low energy whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy
 just took millions of 's in special interest money to look like a tough guy will never work
will in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate
why doesn't in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate
 's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terriblefumbled around incoherent
 well i'm at and your at you know jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage classic
 the donald should've been named man of the year he dominates the polls news talk shows social media maga
women defy media narrative love trump at packed michigan rally video 
watching and consider to be one of the least talented people on television boring and biased
jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements he is really pathetic
once again is dishonest schlonged is not vulgar when i said hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly
npr's said schlonged to wapo re mondaleferraro campaign that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls 
for those on tv defending my use of the word schlonged bc is giving it false meaningtell them it means beaten badly dishonest 
wow new reuters poll just out big lead if you want to make america great again trump cruz this is at the top of drudge
 twittercomtudwrgrsd
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly the media knows this often used word in politics
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong sad
we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again

the which is the lobbyist power for not imposing taxes on today did a nasty cartoon attacking kids bad
 treats me so badly using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out poll all negative
why does give so much airtime he and other fox pundits is so biased still thinks romney won unfair coverage of trump
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media new poll amazing in all categories pt lead
hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to i have great respect for women be careful
merry christmas happy holidays 
hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign i deplore the death and destruction she causedstupidity
 why is hillary even allowed to run she's a criminal good question
 why is hillary even allowed to run she's a criminal
a great christmas movie perfect story 
 jim you fail to mention in your cnn poll that in the gop racetrump is leading cruz to big detail
poor spent million on his campaign i spent almost nothing he's bottom and gone i'm top by a lot that's what us needs
in the ridiculous ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him so sad
wow even lowly rand paul has just past in the new poll jeb is at i'm at stop throwing your money down the drain
third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing are totally in the hillary circle of bias think about bill
next year will be an interesting one i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids it's about time
why isn't using the much newer poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll cnn even better
 and very dishonest in not showing the new poll where i am at points higher than cruz be honest chuck
i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight make america great again
 should have talked to megyn kelly about this story true a total distortion of the facts
 why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video bad reporting perhaps will do better next yearbut doubt it

the same people that said i wouldn't run or that i wouldn't lead or do well st place and leading by now say i won't beat hillary
the phoenix va it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before the wait is horrendous and people are dying i will fix it
criminal deportations in the us are the lowest number in many years we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country must change
 story 
a new terror warning was issued for european cties at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart weak leaders
 if the insurance companies are making lots of money and the uninsured is still largeobamacare is a failure since so expensive
hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate
thank you

 andreajmarkley rubio finally gets an endorsement from loser gowdy via dailyne
 face it trey gowdy failed miserably on benghazi he allowed it to drag out and in the end let hillary get away with murder
 my prediction on the trey gowdy endorsement of rubio is that it will do nothing for rubio and finish gowdy
 he supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that trey gowdy is going to campaign with him
 we need the change trump is going to make not the change obama did by ruining the country
 you will come out tops mr trump you are sincere genuine hard working honest and willl do what you promise the people
it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters bad
rpvirginia has lost statewide times in a row will now not allow desperately needed new voters suicidal mistake rnc must act now

why are flunkies and two of the dumbest people in politics always on the panelsand yet polltrump 
 what's going on in va what's the gop doing they will lose the state because of the rnc
 who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her email crime said that i feel wages in america are too high lie
 ana is an illegal who needs to be deported no she's just incompetent
straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late stupid rnc
hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party fast
 we need a real president to get things done and that's why we want you thank you
if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong
the middleclass has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years bad
many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad i will fix
wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few and people have lost faith in our leaderswe need smart and strong leadership now
strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes while he will double triple them a disaster

 is a sad case a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads
 is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls has no chance
hillary clinton said that it is ok to ban muslims from israel by building a wall but not ok to do so in the us we must be vigilant
hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president jeb bush is a low energy individual but hillary is not much better
i hope bill clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women
when i look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware the candidates are mere puppets 
remember i am selffunding my campaign the only one in either party i'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interestsonly the usa

ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until months ago lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow i told you so
ted cruz said he didn't know that he was a canadian citizen he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million loan papersnot believable
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file goldman sachs owns him he will do anything they demand not much of a reformer
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there
oh no just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan this one from citi wow no wonder banks do so well in the us senate
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks
ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him
great new numbers thank you 
ted is the ultimate hypocrite says one thing for money does another for votes 
if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage
everybody that loves the people of new york and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics
when will give all the new york based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him
greatly dishonest of to file a financial disclosure form not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up wall st
departing nh now great morning with record crowd in portsmouth in a snow storm thank you

 one of the national review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog why doesn't he say that
the only reason irrelevant doesn't like me is i refused to do his failing show asked many times very few listeners sad
cruz says i supported tarp which gave million to goldman sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose puppet
cruz did not renounce his canadian citizenship as a us senator only when he started to run for he could be canadian prime minister
is cruz honest he is in bed w wall st is funded by goldman sachsciti low interest loans no legal disclosure never sold off assets

the new email release is a disaster for hillary clinton at a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president
the great state of nebraska can do much better than as your senator saw him on totally ineffective wants paid for pols
 looks more like a gym rat than a us senator how the hell did he ever get elected 
amazing that ted cruz can't even get a senator like who is easy to endorse him not one senator is endorsing canada ted
 is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night raised in one hour for our vets
 the people of iowa love the fact that i stuck up for my rights as i will do for the us also got for our vets
looking forward to a great weekend in iowa tickets 
 so bill if america was so longing to learn more about candidates why the percent audience loss
 damn fox is really acting like a baby today i guess trump got under their skin pretty biased
thank you to all of the incredible volunteers behind the scenes in iowa 
hillary clinton is a major national security risk not presidential material
i will be in iowa all day and until tuesday morning finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will make america great again
i want to thank evangelical christians for the warm embrace i've received on the campaign trail video 
make america great again 
the cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation they are now under investigation bad
 is a total phony and dishonest guy asked me for expensive hotel rooms free and more i said pay and he endorsed cruz
 asked me to do an event the people holding the event called me to say he wanted for himselfphony 
 is a total phony and con man when i wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed cruz 
i will be going to church in iowa this morning with my wife melania after church i will be making two speeches and touring the state
ted cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run born in canada will loose big to hillary polls show i beat hillary easily win
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form very low interest loans scam
wow just saw an ad cruz is lying on so many levels there is nobody more against obamacare than me will repeal replace he lies
by not doing the failed poorly rated debate i was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising for vets
if i would have done the last debate a record would have been set instead of the poor ratings recieved also vets got 
i am in iowa will be interviewed on this week with this morning enjoy
i will be interviewed on face the nation with this morning enjoy

join us am waterloo pm ceder rapids 
it all begins today we will finally take our country back and make america great again
my experience in iowa was a great one i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn't do well there and ended up in nd place nice
because i was told i could not do well in iowa i spent very little there a fraction of cruz rubio came in a strong second great honor
the media has not covered my longshot great finish in iowa fairly brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the medialater in new hampshire big crowd
i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for selffunding my campaign the only one i will keep doing but not worth it
 on he finished nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro
 you must win the presidency in 
 if you can do that well in iowa then i see you acing it in all other significant states momentum is growing
 amazing job in iowa cruz just barely won
 iowa is meaninglesskeep pushing forward run the table in nh sc nv and super tuesday america needs you 
 all you haters need to realize trump got the second highest vote in history and he's never held office
anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment
on my way to new hampshire expecting a big and spirited crowd 
great job on tonight begged us for a job we said no and she went hostile a real dummy 
ted cruz didn't win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad
during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for cruz
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified
i will be interviewed on at pm enjoy 
this was sent out from ted cruz as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote twittercomtrmkucrsu
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud
cruz just lied again i am and have been totally against repeal and replace
dr ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies

like the worthless looks like will be going out of business bad reporting no money no cred
such a great experience in new hampshire amazing people will be leaving for a big event in south carolina today
so funny jeb bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer i assume that is a compliment
big speech tonight in south carolina pm tremendous crowd
i was referring to the fact that jeb bush wants to keep common core
 which is it are you planning on getting rid of common core or keeping it get rid of it fast
thank you clemson south carolina twittercomfgacmafxxc
i have been consistent in my opposition to common core get rid of common core keep education local
there are no buyers for the worthless but little mort zuckerman is frantically looking it is bleeding red ink a total loser
jeb bush spent more than in new hampshire to come in or i spent to come in st big difference in capability
 showed a focus group on me using a very bad word i never said the word left an open blank please apologize
remember it was the republican party with the help of conservatives that made so many promises to their base but didn't keep them hi dt
he or she who hesitates is lost make america great again
jeb failed as jeb he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother who got us into the quicksand of iraq spent millionweakno chance
we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me we are watching

thank you baton rouge louisiana we will twittercomxveieal
weak jeb getting thrown out by management during speech do you think he will be this tough on putin others

how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest
nevada tomorrow is the deadline to register republican visit message from 
the failing destroyed by little morty zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online it's dead
you must be registered republican by february th to vote trump in the florida primary 
nothing conservative about the club for growth coming into my office and demanding a m contribution which naturally they did not get
after hearing the news that they would not be able to extort m from me they went hostile w a series of incorrect illinformed ads
lightweight is spending a fortune of special interest against me in sc false advertising desperate and sad
if doesnt clean up his act stop cheating doing negative ads i have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen
last time lightweight tried to knock off he made a total fool of himself if he doesn't do better this time he is out
 you have just been put on notice we stand with you thankyou
 good i want to see the court decide what i was always told natural born means born on american soil
 do americans really want a canadianborn president first non native born in history
millions of 's of false ads paid for by lobbyistsspecial interests of cheater and sleepy are now running in sc
i will end illegal immigration and protect our borders we need to make america safe great again 
 inside venue tonight in tampa broke record set by elton john in wout musical instruments another outside will be back

 nice column by bill donahue head of catholic league he's a blue collar new yorker and gets it 
now an additional jobs in america being eliminated for move to mexico via hartford courant 
the rnc which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying trump wants you to contribute to the rnc

a very big thank you to bill donohue head of the catholic league for the wonderful interview on and article in newsmax great insight

thank you south carolina we will make america safe great again 
 we know better than to trust the rnc so cute

love the people of south carolina look very much forward to the debate tonight
the totally unexpected loss of supreme court justice antonin scalia is a massive setback for the conservative movement and our country
wow honored to be chosen by the highly respected accurate washington lee mock convention i hope you are right i will make you proud
nasty ted cruz is at it again same dirty tricks he used w saying i may not be on ballot i hold liberal positions lies
ted cruz is a cheater he holds the bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts
on the way to the with my wonderful wife 
lightweight said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in texas lie 
thank you i miss my father 
how can beat hillary clinton if he can't beat anyone else on the stage with m i am the only one who can
all polls have me winning debate big drudge time etc dopey charles krauthammer still nasty he has zero cred totally dishonest
hey see how i beat your boy ted in your own blaze poll your endorsement means nothing 
 twittercomyvxfubckns
 you crushed the debate thank you
even though every poll time drudge etc has me winning the debate by a lot only puts negative people on biased a total joke
 jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby
this shows what a complete total liar ted cruz is he said he wouldn't have nominated john roberts really 
i will be on face the nation with john dickerson on cbs this morning enjoy
thank you for your support together we will make america great again 
loved the debate last night and almost everyone said i won but the rnc did a terrible job of ticket distrbution all donors special ints
tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists special interests the bosses
wow in the new cbs poll i went way up into the forties thank you
ted cruz along with jeb bush pushed justice john roberts onto the supreme court roberts could have killed obamacare twice but didn't
funny that jeb didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last namethen mommy now brother
jeb bush and ted cruz are not electable presidential candidates hillary would destroy them ted may not be eligible to run born in canada
i will be in south carolina all week saturday is big big big get out and vote make america great again
now that george bush is campaigning for jeb is he fair game for questions about world trade center iraq war and eco collapse careful
i'd like to call jeb a liar but the truth is he has no clue never revealed that he used eminent domain when criticizing me 
jeb used eminent domain took advantage of a disabled vet in the process 
jeb is a hypocrite used massive private eminent domain just another clueless politician 
response to the lies of senator cruz

 fox trump haters r scared because they lose trump is winning 
why does devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative without me her ratings would tank get a life megyn
 scary how smoothly cruz looks into the camera and lies about trump cant be 
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i would never be president this from perhaps the worst president in us history
 who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace saying the most horrible things about me on 
i will beat hillary easily but lindsey graham says i won't and yet he got zero against me no cred why does fox put him on
 is so biased it is disgusting they do not want trump to win all negative

 thetrump phenomenon summed up leadership fighter and winner not a liar 
 get out if you don't nothing will change it's that simple 
 is really starting to campaign hard for marcorubio he is weak on illegal immigration
 mrtrumpboth cruz and rubio are ineligible to be potus it's a slam dunk case check it 
 why does ted cruz lie so much let's face it ted never created even job his entire life 
 is the only one who will protect american interests 
 everybody on twitter get out to vote for trump today in south carolina
 this veteran voted for trump in tx early voting 
i am the only candidate in many years who is selffunding his campaign lobbyists and interests totally control all other candidates
 trump expressed concerns months after the iraq war began while of americans still supported the war 
 all aboard the trump train
i wonder if president obama would have attended the funeral of justice scalia if it were held in a mosque very sad that he did not go
remember that marco rubio is very weak on illegal immigration south carolina needs strength as illegals and syrians pour in don't allow it
south carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands vote now today and make america great again
 this veteran just voted in the sc primary let's make america great again
people pundits gave me no chance in south carolina now it looks like a possible win i would be happy with a one vote victory hope

thank you south carolina 
thank you atlanta georgia leaving for nevada now lets make america safe and great again 
a number of months ago i was not expected to win south carolinated cruz was and yet i won in a landslide every group and category win
 nevada we are on our way caucus locator 
i am in las vegas at the best hotel by far trump international i will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to win nevada
the reason that ted cruz lost the evangelicals in sc is because he is a world class liar and evangelicals do not like liars
 you really rocked them hard in sc rubio and cruz were pummled so glad jeb is gone next no liar
 floridians are upset because rubio did not do what he promised once he was elected vote trump
i hear the rickets family who own the chicago cubs are secretly spending 's against me they better be careful they have a lot to hide
 no matter what liar sleazeball says about in tennessee we have early voting and has won
 florida starts early voting on march extending to march absentee ballots have been sent out 
many people are now saying i won south carolina because of the last debate i showed anger and the people of our country are very angry
thank you for your endorsement video 
it is so important to audit the federal reserve and yet ted cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done
wow ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director more dirty tricks
ted cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false no basis in fact take ad down ted biggest liar in politics
ted cruz has now apologized to marco rubio and ben carson for fraud and dirty tricks no wonder he has lost evangelical support
just saw the phony ad by cruz totally false more dirty tricks he got caught in so many lies is this man crazy
ted cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in iowa weak rnc and republican leadership probably won't let this happen sad
i will be on tonight from las vegas nevada at pme enjoy twittercommxrxfohl

join me live now in las vegas nevada we will make america safe great again 
thank you las vegas nevada 
ted cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in sc he is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration
wow was ted cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication he used him as a scape goatfired like a dog ted panicked
ted cruz does not have the right temperment to be president look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm bad
ted cruz lifts the bible high into the air and then lies like a dogover and over again the evangelicals in sc figured him out said no
 gets it was just on explaining how trump wins the general election thank you ed
 trump is unstoppablehe is what common sense americans want whether republican independent or a reagan democrat

big defeat last night in nevada for ted cruz and marco rubio on is working hard to belittle my victory rove is sick
 poll and say that i beat both hillary and bernie and i havn't even started on them yet
i am self funding my campaign don't owe anybody anything i only owe it to the american people watch 
i am in virginia presidential forum with dr pat robertson beginning now watch here bei regent university
in all of television the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory was dopey he should be fired
make america great again 
the polls show that i picked up many jeb bush supporters that is how i got to when others drop out i will pick up more sad but true
mitt romneywho totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy
 oh great is doing a on like losing the presidency wasn't enough he's a fool
when mitt romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win
why would texans vote for liar ted cruz when he was born in canada lived there for yearsand remained a canadian citizen until recently
when ted cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear i will get most of his votes no problem
 chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement i will not let you down 
 this texan will be voting trump march st cruz is a fake texan
 that's why we are angry the republican establishment will not support you you are who the american people want
texas georgia many more vote early this is a movement vote video 
ted cruz is lying again polls are showing that i do beat hillary clinton head to head check out poll snd q poll
 mr tough guy romney should be backing trump like trump backed him last time 
 a vote for or is a vote for corruption special interests and lobbyists trump for potus
 trump is so impressive and no other politician has his passion energy to 
 love it is done we need someone who is proven will make america great again
 romney should have been a tough guy with obama he cowered and lost badly he's not relevant
 romney is a pawn of the establishment and has no individual thought process he is jealous of trump
 hates to see trump's success when he was so pathetic
great new poll thank you texas 
mitt romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns dope
why doesnt just endorse already should have done it before nh or nevada where he had a little sway too late now
just for your info tax returns have to do w someones net worth i have already filed my financial statements w fec they are great
signing a recent tax return isn't this ridiculous 
lets make america great again schedule tickets

 he won almost all polls and mark halperin gave him an a
 tonight you proved to america you are the real deal you took fire from all sides stayed composed returned fire and won
 that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before favorite line from tonights debate
 marco cruz and ted rubio easy to get the two politicians confused looked like desperate panicked dc insiders tonight
 trump won the debate disgusting rubio said peed is he still in junior high school
 cruz talks about hillary all the time because he knows he can't beat you trump will win texas 
 yup polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not trump
i will be making a speech at in fort worth texas really big crowd expected will be talking about the debate last nightplus plus
have a good chance to win texas on tuesday cruz is a nasty guy not one senate endorsement and despite talk gets nothing done loser
why would the people of florida vote for marco rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their senator and then quit
will be at fort worth texas convention center at am big crowd get there early big announcement to be made
lying ted cruz and lightweight choker marco rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement they failed
lightweight choker marco rubio looks like a little boy on stage not presidential material
wow every poll said i won the debate last night great honor
lightweight marco rubio was working hard last night the problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker mr meltdown
they don't like rubio in florida he left them high dry doesn't even show up for votes
thank you for your support friendship governor twittercomjviqjh
never let them see you sweat 
thank you texas amazing supporters twittercomtcbdktpbp

thank you pastor robert jeffress twittercomndkumry
 michigan gop poll trump rubio cruz kasich carson wow
i will be on at am will be talking about lightweight marco rubio and lying ted cruz
 there's only one real candidate and it's you donors control the other candidates thank you
i unfairly get audited by the irs almost every single year i have rich friends who never get audited i wonder why
tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit after the audit no problem
i am selffunding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight rubio or ted cruz
fun to watch the democrats working so hard to win the great state of south carolina when i just won the republican version amazing people
i only wish my wonderful father fred gave me million to start my business like lightweight rubio says he didn't total fabrication
i started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the world amazing
 was just banned by their loss tough loyal guy
just watched lightweight marco rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record he is not as smart as cruz and may be an even bigger liar
it was an honor to be the grand marshall in the salute to israel parade back in 
incredibly proud of my son his efforts on behalf of in memphis tn 
thank you arkansas get out on tuesday we will make america safe great again 
we need to fix our broken education system video 
 donaldtrump is a leader he is a successful person that like me isnt afraid to tell it like it is governor 
 go trump
 marco 'amnesty' rubio is the front man of amnesty 
 it is a sad commentary little boy marco rubio can't win in his home state floridians despise him as a opportunist phony
 anything is better than 
 it is better to live one day as a lion than years as a sheep 
 a lot more water after this bombshell rubio you are an enemy of america 
while i hear the koch brothers are in big financial trouble oil word is they have chosen little marco rubio the lightweight from florida
the republican establishment has been pushing for lightweight senator marco rubio to say anything to hit trumpi signed the pledgecareful
while hillary and i both won south carolina by big margins repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cyclesgrowing party

crazy is now complaining that did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on metough
the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liarsa big problem

big republican dinner tonight at maralago in palm beach i will be there

 the media is corrupt we the people are fighting with you
 here's trump in case anyone missed it it is a must watch 
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was not anymore it is from a different world us must be vigilant and smart
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly
make america great again
i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and its not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today
watch this clip from earlier this year time time again i have been right about terrorism its time to get tough 
my heart prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible tragedy this madness must be stopped and i will stop it
 video twittercombkruyyhfma
 message from 
 message from 
obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame
pres obama should leave the baseball game in cuba immediately get home to washington where a under a serious emergency belongs
lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin' ted or i will spill the beans on your wife
incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and openand let the muslims flow in no way
thank you arizona twittercomvmczxrryg
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices
lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania that's why we call him lyin' ted
thank you arizona 
lyin ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas just another dishonest politician
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin ted cruz honestly i cant blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror shes been in office fighting terror for years and look where we are
i will be the best by far in fighting terror im the only one that was right from the beginning now lyin ted others are copying me
i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted jeb spent more than and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race
i want to thank for all of his help in our historic arizona win could not have done it without you joe
make america great again
 you have over m followers more than than this says something about how america feels 
 selffunded and media loves him not beholden to masters like who owns ted
 donald trump will be greater president than ragan trump will set the button for moralitychristianity
 a picture is worth a thousand words 
nato is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of nato why it is time to renegotiate and the time is now
 thank god is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people
it is amazing how gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run
 and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing
these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better
remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing wrote a critical article i was so right
it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato
 talkers think about the future doers are already building it 
hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years time for a change i will solve and fast
 tv show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on i tell them no
explain how the women on the view which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left ever got their jobs is wasting time
 they're all braindead puppets with skeletons in their closet i say you go on and destroy them all a dead show
just announced that as many as isis fighters have infiltrated europe also many in us i told you so i alone can fix this problem
europe and the us must immediately stop taking in people from syria this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad
 cruz rubio are scared watch 
endorsements for lyin' ted cruz 
make america great again 
just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it if i lostmonster story
i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania he did he knew the pac was putting it out hence lyin' ted
wow just released that million in negative ads was spent on me how am i still number one by a lot
 blames for so many things i am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis
top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking weak leaders ridiculous laws
 your instincts on foreign policy terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined
 turns out was wrong had nothing to do with it 
 let me help you trumpophobes with math trump bm ' equitym sp 
 dear after doing a quick google twitter search there are over women's groups supporting donaldtrump stop lying
 women love trump trump's execs predominantly female 
the media is so after me on women wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite
lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enqwere caused by me i had nothing to do with story
nobody will protect our nation like donald j trump our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong illegals out
wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in us jobs are leaving i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs
don't believe the polls they are just another phony hit job on me i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election
remember i am the only candidate who is selffunding while i am given little credit for this by the voters i am not bought like others
i am interviewed on this week on this morning enjoy
wow sleepy eyes is at it again he is do totally biased the things i am saying are correct far better vision than the others
my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the us are now finally receiving plaudits
happy easter to all have a great day
another radical islamic attack this time in pakistan targeting christian women children at least dead injured i alone can solve
why can't the pundits be honest hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again i will make it strong and great jobs
just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruzlawsuit coming
see lyin' ted even the no fan of mine says this story came from rubio not trump

lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate their donors special interest groups are not happy with them sad
lyin' ted cruz and for kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one shows weakness
shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only win and losses

paul ryan said that i inherited something very special the republican party wrong i didn't inherit it i won it with millions of voters
crooked hillary has zero leadership ability as bernie sanders says she has bad judgement constantly playing the women's card it is sad
thank you to teachers across america when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now
joe scarborough initially endorsed jeb bush and jeb crashed then john kasich and that didn't work not much power or insight
i hear of rapidly fading is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run this will guarantee a crooked hillary win
response to 
i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate i will defeat them both
lets properly check goofy elizabeth warrens records to see if she is native american i say shes a fraud
goofy elizabeth warren hillary clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie she is not native american
just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy
crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me
goofy elizabeth warren and her phony native american heritage are on a twitter rant she is too easy i'm driving her nuts
goofy elizabeth warren is weak and ineffective does nothing all talk no action maybe her native american name
join me in washington today spokane tickets lynden tickets 
i am going to keep our jobs in the us and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure crooked hillary has no clue

 good interview mr trump you set the facts straight thank you
will be interviewed by on at am enjoy
 you had a great interview with donald today i started watching your show due to donald trump
 the liars that signed the pledge and now won't support is the reason they are losers
 is chris serious lying or misinformed bill clinton signed nafta 
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump but i had people to beatshe had one
if i only had person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton i would have gotten million more votes than she did
i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party despite having to compete against other people
i am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate any negotiated increase by congress to my proposal would still be lower than current
thank you jason greenblatt for our children let's elect donald trump 
 i am a woman i just voted for 
get out and vote west virginia we will make america great again
get out and vote nebraska we will make america great again
 great job on this morning thank you for the nice words
why does the media with a strong push from crooked hillary keep pushing the false narrative that i want to raise taxes exactly opposite
it was rosie o'donnell who ate the cake in the vicious hillary commercial about me not crooked hillary 
it is only the people that were never asked to be vp that tell the press that they will not take the position
nebraska today 
west virginia today twittercompndazjsruy

big wins in west virginia and nebraska get ready for november crooked hillary who is looking very bad against crazy bernie will lose
i don't want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary his time will come
goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire us senate she has done nothing
goofy elizabeth warren didnt have the guts to run for potus her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold
 twittercomclhqgybbyr
thanks piers 
if the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been she would lose
goofy elizabeth warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked hillary see her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you
our native american senator goofy elizabeth warren couldnt care less about the american workerdoes nothing to help
goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage see mediaasking for increase
isnt it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump gets nothing done in senate
in interview i told that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election
if it were up to goofy elizabeth warren wed have no jobs in americashe doesnt have a clue
great day in dc with and republican leadership things working out really well twittercomhfhymdac

 everyone continues to pile onto donald but they can never take away our votes thank you
 keep shiningthe ppl will not let the media dim your lightwe no longer believe them thanks
why doesn't the failing write the real story on the clintons and women the media is totally dishonest
wow i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing piece massive front page for that
why did the failing refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers dishonest
the media is really on a witchhunt against me false reporting and plenty of it but we will prevail

bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems the system is rigged against him he should run as an independent run bernie run
that was an amazing interview on i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the is
the is so dishonest their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer who said it was a lie

thank you anthony the entrepreneur's case for trump 
rowanne brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing story yesterday joined 
the failing is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women
no wonder the is failingwho can believe what they write after the false malicious libelous story they did on me
over women were interviewed by the yet they only wrote about thats because there were so many positive statements
the writer of the now proven false story in the michael barbaro who was interviewed on cbs this morning was unable to respond
in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in us history
i gave a woman named barbara res a top ny construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty so much for a nice thank you
what barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back i said no
 oregon votes today go vote for and kick it big time 
wow emails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton she said they had to do with a wedding reception liar how can she run

crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women can't believe she would misrepresent the facts my hit was on china
oregon is voting today keep the big numbers going vote trump make america great again

i look so forward to debating crooked hillary clinton democrat primaries are rigged email investigation is rigged so time to get it on
 he will destroy hillary but why give cnn record breaking ratings cnn can go to hell trump 
michael barbaro the author of the now discredited hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me he should resign

bernie sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton he will endorse her today fans angry
i am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters they are not happy that he is selling out

bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs
bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing prowar protpp prowall street crooked hillary clinton

as the days and weeks go by we see what a total mess our country and world is in crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made bernie said she has bad judgement
i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas as her vp then we can litigate her fraud
if goofy elizabeth warren a very weak senator didn't lie about her heritage being native american she would be nothing today pick her h
 is much better and far more truthful than which is all negative guests are stacked for crooked hillary i don't watch

it was truly an honor to introduce my wife melania her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible very proud 
 democrats are coming to trump i used to be proud of the dem party no more it is crooked and not for the people
the roll call is beginning at the republican national convention very exciting
such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states i will work hard and never let you down america first
congratulations to my children don and tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night i am very proud of you
bill hemmer of was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena more than in past years
in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state jobs
good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press
the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails
statement on melania speech

another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did
i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn how to defeat radical islam
 general michael flynn will make a great secretary of defense when you become potus 
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing
pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her
leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more online from wikileakes really vicious rigged
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they don't look presidential to me
the wikileaks email release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud
thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart
 kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals 
 dinesh d'sousa hillary's america see it
 twittercomgczhxnyxd
the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h
bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect
wow president obama's brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else
looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad
today proves what i have always known that priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debbie wasserman shultz 
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left
the panels are so one sided almost all against trump is so much better and the ratings are much higher don't watch cnn
if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive well
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory she's out
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on minutes no way they are going to fix america's problems isis all others laughing
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against bernie
hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened
thank you twittercompzsuwgzam
if bernie sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc they just got caught that's all they laughed at bernie
here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance
wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change
great poll numbers are coming out all over people don't want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse 
make america safe and great again 
thank you roanoke virginia be back soon 
thank you ohio 
clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke
i was at and met juan williams in passing he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs
elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time
funny if you listen to the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great
pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch
join us tomorrow in scranton pennsylvania at pm tickets 
join us in toledo ohio tomorrow night at pm tickets 
thank you new hampshire twittercomkrcdvbqp
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar
bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed
dems don't want to talk isis bc hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy
for the record i have zero investments in russia
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing please get your facts straight thanks 
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated
i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep
just like i have warned from the beginning crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp 
as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv
funny how the failing is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius america st
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition sad
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no
our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz
not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one pathetic
join our next vice president in wisconsin tonight michigan thursday mi wi

hillary's refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words
hillary will never reform wall street she is owned by wall street
hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety
hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction terrorism and isis across the world
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke and the little watched sad
crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream

little michael bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me his last term as mayor was a disaster

violent crime is rising across the united states yet the dnc convention ignored it crime reduction will be one of my top priorities
crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes a formula for disaster
 twittercomxyopfjmbyp
why doesn't the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republican's won ratings
i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better
word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta
 obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth seen below 
crooked's stop in johnstown pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than with bill vp
the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico end

captain khan killed years ago was a hero but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it
i was viciously attacked by mr khan at the democratic convention am i not allowed to respond hillary voted for the iraq war not me
the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention i wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h
 without absolutely owning the liberal media hillaryclinton wouldn't stand a chance and her only hope
wow it is unbelievable how distorted onesided and biased the media is against us the failing is a joke is laughable
mr khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over tv doing the same nice
this story is not about mr khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather radical islamic terrorism and the us get smart
when i said in an interview that putin is not going into ukraine you can mark it down i am saying if i am president already in crimea
so with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine they have already taken crimea and continue to push that's what i said

will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding or are they worried it will hurt hillary
the people who support hillary sit behind cnn anchor chairs or headline fundraisers those disconnected from real life

if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words i say i would be beating hillary by 
my rallies are not covered properly by the media they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media she is not a talented person or politician the dishonest media refuses to expose
i am not only fighting crooked hillary i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process people get it
it is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false
i have always been the same personremain true to selfthe media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so
stay on message is the chant i always do trade jobs military vets nd a repeal ocare borders etc but media misrepresents

while hillary profits off the rigged system i am fighting for you remember the simple phrase 
wow did you see how badly clinton news network is doing in the ratings with people like who could expect any more
anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying sources said do not believe it there are no sources they are just made up lies
wow crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past which is terrible
using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement hillary was set up by a con
did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a us citizen so she could use her in the debate
remember don't believe sources said by the very dishonest media if they don't name the sources the sources don't exist
the people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the dallas arizona papers now usa today will lose readers the people get it
why isn't hillary points ahead maybe it's the email scandal policies that spread isis or calling millions of americans deplorables

it is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and i can now fight for america the way i want to
with the exception of cheating bernie out of the nom the dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the republicans
disloyal r's are far more difficult than crooked hillary they come at you from all sides they dont know how to win i will teach them

polls close but can you believe i lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events that never happened media rigging election
election is being rigged by the media in a coordinated effort with the clinton campaign by putting stories that never happened into news
they let crooked the gang off the hook for the crime but it looks like the coverup is just as bad unbelievable 
a country that crooked hillary says has funded isis also gave wild bill million for his birthday so corrupt 
hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over who would trust these people with national security 
we've all wondered how hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme wikileaks may have found the answer obama 
the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary but also at many polling places sad
the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted even senior fbi officials thought crooked was guilty 
join me in wisconsin tomorrow or colorado on tuesday green bay pm colorado springs pm

can't believe these totally phoney stories made up by women many already proven false and pushed big time by press have impact
 watch joe biden's long history of grabbing kissing and groping women who are cringing 
 trump accuser praised him in an email as recently as april this is all yet another hoax terrible
 peter thiel chooses now to give mil in support of trump 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive
we have all got to come together and win this election we can't have four more years of obama or worse
wikileaks proves even the clinton campaign knew crooked mishandled classified info but no one gets charged rigged 
unbelievable

fidel castro is dead
the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated demoralized dems
the democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted not so anymore
hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in nothing will change
hillary's debate answer on delay that is horrifying that is not the way our democracy works been around for years we've had free 
and fair elections we've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a 
during a general election i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind 
of position then separately she stated he said something truly horrifying he refused to say that he would respect the results of 
this election that is a direct threat to our democracy she then said we have to accept the results and look to the future donald 
trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead so much time and money will be spent same result sad
in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
it would have been much easier for me to win the socalled popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in or 
states instead of the states that i visited i would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten
serious voter fraud in virginia new hampshire and california so why isn't the media reporting on this serious bias big problem

 just another generic cnn part time wannabe journalist still doesn't get it they will never learn
 pathetic you have no sufficient evidence that donald trump did not suffer from voter fraud shame bad reporter
 there is no question that did take place and in favor of 
 is so embarrassed by their total support of hillary clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don't know what to do
the great state of michigan was just certified as a trump win giving all of our make america great again supporters another victory

bill clinton stated that i called him after the election wrong he called me with a very nice congratulations he doesn't know much 
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states and more they focused on wrong states
yes it is true carlos slim the great businessman from mexico called me about getting together for a meeting we met he is a great guy
campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult sophisticated than the popular vote hillary focused on the wrong states
i would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently
i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss

may be their number one act and priority focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance

i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in nyc thank you
the intelligence briefing on socalled russian hacking was delayed until friday perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange
julian assange said a year old could have hacked podesta why was dnc so careless also said russians did not give him the info
 julian assange on us media coverage its very dishonest more dishonest than anyone knows
thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating new jobs in the us this is just the beginning much more to follow
somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible
things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass
republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases
like the hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless don't let the schumer clowns out of this web
massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful
jackie evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performancesome people just don't understand the movement
the democrats lead by head clown chuck schumer know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in instead of working to fix it they
do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginningkeep you doctor keep your plan it is
time for republicans democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive far better
the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people
to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan
toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja mexico to build corolla cars for us no way build plant in us or pay big border tax
how did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented who gave them this report and why politics
the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia
so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on
the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed will be paid back by mexico later
hillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the
and knew they were in big trouble which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minutethey saw a movement like never before

happy birthday 
gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take placethe republican national committee had strong defense
intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results voting machines not touched
only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed
having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad we
have enough problems around the world without yet another one when i am president russia will respect us far more than they do now and
both countries will perhaps work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world

the democrats have said some of the worst things about james comey including the fact that he should be fired but now they play so sad
james comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job bringing back the spirit and prestige of the fbi
comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in washington republican and democrat alike when things calm down they will be thanking me

yesterday on the same day i had meetings with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and the fm of ukraine pavlo klimkin 
again the story that there was collusion between the russians trump campaign was fabricated by dems as an excuse for losing the election
the fake media is working overtime today
as a very active president with lots of things happening it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy
maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future press briefings and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy
james comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press
when james clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt says there is no collusion when does it end

it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the white house are fabricated lies made up by the media
whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media and they don't mention names
it is very possible that those sources don't exist but are made up by fake news writers is the enemy
does anyone notice how the montana congressional race was such a big deal to dems fake news until the republican won v was poorly covered

i look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this memorial day at arlington national cemetery later this morning
we have a massive trade deficit with germany plus they pay far less than they should on nato military very bad for us this will change
russian officials must be laughing at the us how a lame excuse for why the dems lost the election has taken over the fake news
the us senate should switch to votes immediately and get healthcare and tax cuts approved fast and easy dems would do it no doubt
who can figure out the true meaning of covfefe enjoy

we need to be smart vigilant and tough we need the courts to give us back our rights we need the travel ban as an extra level of safety
whatever the united states can do to help out in london and the u k we will be there we are with you god bless
we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people if we don't get smart it will only get worse
at least dead and wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is no reason to be alarmed
do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now that's because they used knives and a truck
people the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but i am calling it what we need and what it is a travel ban
the justice dept should have stayed with the original travel ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to sc
the justice dept should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court seek much tougher version
in any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the us in order to help keep our country safe the courts are slow and political
 dems are taking forever to approve my people including ambassadors they are nothing but obstructionists want approvals

sorry folks but if i would have relied on the fake news of cnn nbc abc cbs washpost or nytimes i would have had zero chance winning wh
so good to see the saudi arabia visit with the king and countries already paying off they said they would take a hard line on funding

just out the obama administration knew far in advance of november th about election meddling by russia did nothing about it why
democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums deductibles increase by over remember keep your doctor keep your plan
since the obama administration was told way before the election that the russians were meddling why no action focus on them not t
obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election they didn't want to hurt hillary
i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer
make america great again
hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders is she allowed to so collude unfair to bernie
the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists they have no policies or ideas all they do is delay and complainthey own obamacare
the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win
and did not want to rock the boat he didn't choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good
the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling with months looking at russia
under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of t people colluding there is no collusion no obstruction i should be given apology
republican senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the democrats not easy perhaps just let ocare crash burn
very grateful for the o decision from the u s supreme court we must keep america safe
from bombshell in obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election check out his statement witch hunt
great day for america's future security and safety courtesy of the us supreme court i will keep fighting for the american people win

i just finished a great meeting with the republican senators concerning healthcare they really want to get it right unlike ocare
the failing writes false story after false story about me they don't even call to verify the facts of a story a fake news joke

the senate must go to a vote majority instead of current votes even parts of full repeal need dems control senate crazy

i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi he has pled guilty to those lies it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful there was nothing to hide
 years ago this week a brave seamstress in montgomery alabama uttered one word that changed history 
great job first lady melania 
so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed while crooked hillary clinton on that now famous fbi holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her rigged system or just a double standard
many people in our country are asking what the justice department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress deleted and acid washed emails no justice
congratulations to news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia russia russia witch hunt more networks and papers should do the same with their fake news
i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn just more fake news covering another comey lie
such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco 
tainted no very dishonest fbi agents role in clinton probe under review led clinton email probe clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge
after years of comey with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation and more running the fbi its reputation is in tatters worst in history but fear not we will bring it back to greatness
people who lost money when the stock market went down points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of news he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused many millions of dollars
report antitrump fbi agent led clinton email probe now it all starts to make sense
democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama we need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration border wall military pro life va judges nd amendment and more no to jones a pelosischumer puppet

another false story this time in the failing that i watch hours of television a day wrong also i seldom if ever watch cnn or msnbc both of which i consider fake news i never watch don lemon who i once called the dumbest man on television bad reporting

many mostly democrat states refused to hand over data from the election to the commission on voter fraud they fought hard that the commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally system is rigged must go to voter id
as americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you doexcept when it comes to the most important thing voting for the people that run your country push hard for voter identification

brian ross the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the stock market down points billions of dollars was suspended for a month but is now back at abc news in a lower capacity he is no longer allowed to report on trump should have been fired
now that russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the american public the democrats and their lapdogs the fake news mainstream media are taking out the old ronald reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence
actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames i went from very successful businessman to top tv star
to president of the united states on my first try i think that would qualify as not smart but geniusand a very stable genius at that

the stock market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only record setting stock prices but present and future jobs jobs jobs seven trillion dollars of value created since our big election win
his is turning out to be an enormously consequential presidency so much so that despite my own frustration over his missteps there has never been a day when i wished hillary clinton were president not one indeed as trumps accomplishments accumulate the mere thought of
clinton in the wh doubling down on barack obamas failed policies washes away any doubts that america made the right choice this was truly a change election and the changes trump is bringing are farreaching necessary thank you michael goodwin

it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case such as daca always runs to the th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts
the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trumprussia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace must have tough primary

democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold a first
the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border risking thousands of lives in the process it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans we must build a great wall think merit and end lottery chain usa
reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for billion dollars bad deal wanted me to cut ribbonno
the socalled bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards wall was not properly funded chain lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime
countries which are doing badly i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level i want safety and security for our people i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs i want to fund our military not do a dem defund
because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety daca has now taken a big step backwards the dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most get smart make america great again
the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough but this was not the language used what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for daca
sadly democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for daca take care of our military and our country first

the democrats are all talk and no action they are doing nothing to fix daca great opportunity missed too bad
america first
i dont believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca they are all talk and no action this is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have too bad
so much fake news is being reported they dont even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election
the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them i have a good relationship with kim jong un of n korea obviously i didnt say that i said id have a good relationship with kim jong un a big difference fortunately we now record conversations with reporters
and they knew exactly what i said and meant they just wanted a story fake news
daca is probably dead because the democrats dont really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military
i as president want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on merit no more lotteries first
president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy tax cut bonuses to more than workers most explosive stock market rally that weve seen in modern times to from election and grounded in profitability and growth all trump not 
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things president trump reversed the policies of president obama and reversed our economic decline thank you stuart varney 
statement by me last night in florida honestly i dont think the democrats want to make a deal they talk about daca but they dont want to helpwe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they dont want to they dont want security at the border they dont want
to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do my standard is very simple america first make america great again
senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting deals cant get made when there is no trust durbin blew daca and is hurting our military
we must have security at our very dangerous southern border and we must have a great wall to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country
the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military at a time we need it more than ever we need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now no more dangerous lottery
do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative the russian collusion hoax is dead except as it pertains to the dems public gets it
 of trump news coverage was negative and much of it contrived 
unemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled thank you and it will get even much better

the wall is the wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water

not looking good for our great military or safety security on the very dangerous southern border dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy
democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead in order to power through mess
this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present 
for those asking the republicans only have votes in the senate and they need that is why we need to win more republicans in election we can then be even tougher on crime and border and even better to our military veterans

polling shows nearly in americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca fully secures the border ends chain migration cancels the visa lottery if ds oppose this deal they arent serious about dacathey just want open borders

just signed bill our military will now be stronger than ever before we love and need our military and gave them everything and more first time this has happened in a long time also means jobs jobs jobs
without more republicans in congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our military sadly we needed some dem votes for passage must elect more republicans in election
costs on nonmilitary lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the election and beyond this bill is a big victory for our military but much waste in order to get dem votes fortunately daca not included in this bill negotiations to start now
jobless claims have dropped to a year low
the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency told them to redo and send back in proper form
according to the a russian sold phony secrets on trump to the us asking price was million brought down to million to be paid over time i hope people are now seeing understanding what is going on here it is all now starting to come out drain the swamp
peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation some are true and some are false some are old and some are new there is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone is there no such thing any longer as due process
my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clintondnc dossier it shows that hes been victimized hes been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of
agencies not just the fbi doj now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election comey had conversations with donald trump which i dont believe were accuratehe leaked information corrupt tom fitton of judicial watch on 
republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do the dems had all three branches of government back in and they decided not to do anything about daca they only want to use it as a campaign issue vote republican
my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the 
my administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans 
so many positive things going on for the usa and the fake news media just doesnt want to go there same negative stories over and over again no wonder the people no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history 
 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus andor pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut jobs billand it will only get better we are far ahead of schedule

today i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate as well as members of my cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore americas depleted infrastructure 
my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting no child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school
just spoke to governor rick scott we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting
so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem must always report such instances to authorities again and again
while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa
in times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need 
the schumerroundscollins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in america it creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesnt build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa
lottery continues deadly catchandrelease and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement and a vote for open borders if dems are actually serious about daca they should support the grassley bill
presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland florida 
i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered am also working with congress on many fronts
cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democratstotally abandoned republicans are still working hard
russia started their antius campaign in long before i announced that i would run for president the results of the election were not impacted the trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion
our entire nation wone heavy heart continues to pray for the victims their families in parkland fl to teachers law enforcement first responders medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger we thank you for your courage 
melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county florida will never forget them or the evening
charges deal don a big win written by michael goodwin of the succinctly states that the russians had no impact on the election results there was no collusion with the trump campaign she lost the oldfashioned way by being a terrible candidate case closed
deputy ag rod rosenstein stated at the news conference there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the election
funny how the fake news media doesnt want to say that the russian group was formed in long before my run for president maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didnt know
i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was not the main goal rob goldman vice president of facebook ads 
just like they dont want to solve the daca problem why didnt the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house senate during the obama administration because they didnt want to and now they just talk
very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud
general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company
never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation
finally liddle adam schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam
i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia it never did
now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the election but wasnt i a great candidate
if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the us then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams they are laughing their asses off in moscow get smart america
great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot big gain over last weeks i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans the cuts the dems want to take away we need more republicans
thank you to kenstarr former independent counsel whitewater for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse russian meddling etc really great interview with 
my great friends from nascar are having their big race today the daytona brian france and the france family are special people enjoy the race
just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey who at one point i knew very well interview a panel of people on minutes the questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others
have a great but very reflective presidents day
obama was president up to and beyond the election so why didnt he do something about russian meddling
 has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah he will make a great senator and worthy successor to and has my full support and endorsement
the us economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving the unemployment numbers are looking great and regulations taxes have been massively cut jobs jobs jobs
the faith of donald trump a book just out by david brody and scott lamb is a very interesting read enjoy
thank you to for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia including crimea syria and so much more we are now starting to win again
there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig americas elections theres no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so id invite mr trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes 
the president obama quote just before election thats because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didnt want to rock the boat when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems
republicans are now leading the generic poll perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away actually they want to raise you taxes substantially also they want to do nothing on daca rs want to fix
matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event big difference from those days when president obama held the white house youve come a long way matt
hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new pushed congressional map all the way to the supreme court if necessary your original was correct dont let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste money
i have been much tougher on russia than obama just look at the facts total fake news
a woman i dont know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of trump tower years ago never happened who would do this in a public space with live security
cameras running another false accusation why doesnt report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me one had her home mortgage paid off only so reporteddoesnt fit the mainstream media narrative
main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law this shows smallbusiness owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses 
bad ratings got scammed when they covered the antitrump russia rally walltowall they probably knew it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise
so true thank you 
whether we are republican or democrat we must now focus on strengthening background checks
the great billy graham is dead there was nobody like him he will be missed by christians and all religions a very special man
question if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january th why arent they the subject of the investigation why didnt obama do something about the meddling why arent dem crimes under investigation ask jeff sessions

i will always remember the time i spent today with courageous students teachers and families so much love in the midst of so much pain we must not let them down we must keep our children safe full listening session 
i never said give teachers guns like was stated on fake news what i said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best of teachers a lot would now be able to
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this far more assets at much less cost than guards a gun free school is a magnet for bad people attacks would end
history shows that a school shooting lasts on average minutes it takes police first responders approximately to minutes to get to site of crime highly trained gun adept teacherscoaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive great deterrent
if a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will never attack that school cowards wont go thereproblem solved must be offensive defense alone wont work
i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health raise age to and end sale of bump stocks congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue i hope
what many people dont understand or dont want to understand is that wayne chris and the folks who work so hard at the are great people and great american patriots they love our country and will do the right thing make america great again

the democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal bust just confirms all of the terrible things that were done so illegal
dem memo fbi did not disclose who the clients were the clinton campaign and the dnc wow
russians had no compromising information on donald trump of course not because there is none and never was this whole witch hunt is an illegal disgraceand obama did nothing about russia
congressman schiff omitted and distorted key facts so what else is new he is a total phony
i will be interviewed by on at pm enjoy
hes got a very good point somebody in the justice department has a treasure trove of evidence of mrs clintons criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated i fully agree with the president on that on show
ive been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year i just dont see the evidencein terms of the collusion its all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have jonathan turley on 
weve seen no evidence of collusioni have seen nothing the firing of james comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the president has obstructed justice because hes exercising his power as the president of the us i just dont see it judge ken starr

andrew mccabe fired a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi a great day for democracy sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi
happy twittercomvvswsmhb
as the house intelligence committee has concluded there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign as many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi justice state 
the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught called out and fired how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wifes campaign by crooked h friend terry m who was also under investigation how many lies how many leaks comey knew it all and much more
the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign witch hunt
wow watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source he said strongly never no he lied as shown clearly on 
spent very little time with andrew mccabe but he never took notes when he was with me i dont believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date same with lying james comey can we call them fake memos
why does the mueller team have hardened democrats some big crooked hillary supporters and zero republicans another dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair and yet there is no collusion
 on now great am
a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest
the democrats do not want to help daca would be so easy to make a deal

austin bombing suspect is dead great job by law enforcement and all concerned
department of justice should have urged the supreme court to at least hear the drivers license case on illegal immigrants in arizona i agree with should have sought review
there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice so stated by harvard law professor alan dershowitz
special council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council i am still opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because
i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past obama called him also the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong getting along with russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing
they can help solve problems with north korea syria ukraine isis iran and even the coming arms race bush tried to get along but didnt have the smarts obama and clinton tried but didnt have the energy or chemistry remember reset peace through strength
got billion to start wall on southern border rest will be forthcoming most importantly got billion to rebuild our military billion next yearmost ever had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment

much can be done with the billion given to building and fixing the border wall it is just a down payment work will start immediately the rest of the money will come and remember daca the democrats abandoned you but we will not
many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia casedont believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on fame fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted problem is that a new

i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state local governments use our postal system as their delivery boy causing tremendous loss to the us and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business
we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio a tremendous honor to be here today at a stateoftheart training site where the skills of the american worker are forged and refined 
jobs jobs jobs unemployment claims have fallen to a year low together we are making the economy great again 
washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair no more it's time to rebuild and we will do it with american workers american grit and american pride 
while we are on the subject it is reported that the us post office will lose on average for each package it delivers for amazon that amounts to billions of dollars the failing ny times reports that the size of the companys lobbying staff has ballooned and that
does not include the fake washington post which is used as a lobbyist and should so register if the po increased its parcel rates amazons shipping costs would rise by billion this post office scam must stop amazon must pay real costs and taxes now
governor jerry moonbeam brown pardoned criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include kidnapping and robbery badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize dealing drugs is this really what the great people of california want

border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal democrat laws like catch release getting more dangerous caravans coming republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now no more daca deal
mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border and then into the us they laugh at our dumb immigration laws they must stop the big drug and people flows or i will stop their cash cow nafta need wall
these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca they want in on the act
mexico has the absolute power not to let these large caravans of people enter their country they must stop them at their northern border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws
congress must immediately pass border legislation use nuclear option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people border patrol agents and ice are great but the weak dem laws dont allow them to do their job act now congress our country is being stolen
daca is dead because the democrats didnt care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon no longer works must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation democrats want no borders hence drugs and crime
mexico is making a fortune on naftathey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic with all of the money they make from the us hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until congress changes our immigration laws
so funny to watch fake news networks among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc which is a total joke
only fools or worse are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon they lose a fortune and this will be changed also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field
so sad that the department of justice and the fbi are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by congress an embarrassment to our country

 twittercomjazseyees
the fake news networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast the fakers at cnn nbc abc cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction
the big caravan of people from honduras now coming across mexico and heading to our weak laws border had better be stopped before it gets there cash cow nafta is in play as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen congress must act now
check out the fact that you cant get a job at ratings challenged unless you state that you are totally antitrump little jeff zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting

the fbi closed the case on hillary which was a rigged investigation they exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her they never even put her under oath and much more so true jesse 
the washington post is far more fiction than fact story after story is made up garbage more like a poorly written novel than good reporting always quoting sources not names many of which dont exist story on john kelly isnt true just another hit job
president xi and i will always be friends no matter what happens with our dispute on trade china will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do taxes will become reciprocal a deal will be made on intellectual property great future for both countries

so much fake news about what is going on in the white house very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china the coming north korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in syria feels great to have bolton larry k on board i we are
doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation which takes tremendous time and focus no collusion or obstruction other than i fight back so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyers office for information bad
russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria get ready russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart you shouldnt be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it
our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the cold war there is no reason for this russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together stop the arms race
much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake corrupt russia investigation headed up by the all democrat loyalists or people that worked for obama mueller is most conflicted of all except rosenstein who signed fisa comey letter no collusion so they go crazy

so proud of our great military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our country has ever had there wont be anything or anyone even close
unbelievably james comey states that polls where crooked hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the clinton email probe in other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job slimeball
the big questions in comeys badly reviewed book arent answered like how come he gave up classified information jail why did he lie to congress jail why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi why didnt they take it why the phony memos mccabes more
comey throws ag lynch under the bus why cant we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch was she promised a supreme court seat or ag in order to lay off hillary no golf and grandkids talk give us all a break
the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term mission accomplished i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term it should be brought back use often
i never asked comey for personal loyalty i hardly even knew this guy just another of his many lies his memos are self serving and fake
attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past i have many too many lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken all lawyers are deflated and concerned
slippery james comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart will go down as the worst fbi director in history by far
just hit in the rasmussen poll much higher than president obama at same point with all of the phony stories and fake news its hard to believe thank you america we are doing great things

congratulations america we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american historyand there is still no collusion and no obstruction the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money

fake news media had me calling immigrants or illegal immigrants animals wrong they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories i referred to ms gang members as animals a big difference and so true fake news got it purposely wrong as usual
why isnt disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the crooked hillary democrats in virginia led by clinton best friend terry m under fbi investigation that they killed gave to mccabes wife in her run for office then dropped case on clinton

if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee also senate judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers drain the swamp
things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton has done a long boring story indicating that the worlds most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia me so now they are looking at the rest of the world
at what point does this soon to be witch hunt composed of angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for years stop they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they arent looking at the corruption
in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted emails got while secretary of state paid mccabes wife and got off the fbi hook along with terry m and so much more republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam
now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the midterm elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party dont worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier
what ever happened to the server at the center of so much corruption that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of democrats fbi they broke into homes offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the server
and why hasnt the podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington dc
the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia so now theyre looking at the rest of the world oh great
i hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbidoj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration
i ask senator chuck schumer why didnt president obama the democrats do something about trade with china including theft of intellectual property etc they did nothing with that being said chuck i have long agreed on this issue fair trade plus with china will happen
china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farmagricultural products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years
on china barriers and tariffs to come down for first time
china must continue to be strong tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in i want this to happen and north korea to be very successful but only after signing
john brennan is panicking he has disgraced himself he has disgraced the country he has disgraced the entire intelligence community he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of americans faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the
top of the fbi brennan started this entire debacle about president trump we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony dossierhe knows about the dossier he denies knowledge of the dossier he briefs the gang of on the hill about the dossier which
they then used to start an investigation about trump it is that simple this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle this was a political hit job this was not an intelligence investigation brennan has disgraced himself hes worried about staying out of jail dan bongino
the wall street journal asks where in the world was barack obama a very good question

if the person placed very early into my campaign wasnt a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal
follow the money the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped
 new bombshell in the obama spying scandal did other agencies spy on trump campaign even clapper worlds dumbest former intelligence head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word spy when describing the illegal activities
look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with russia a made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before what goes around comes around
its clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign judge andrew napolitano
spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history
everybody is with tomi lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman 
trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign no james clapper i am not happy spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot
our trade deal with china is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion
big legislation will be signed by me shortly after many years right to try and big changes to dodd frank
there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough
witch hunt
thank you twittercommpkwukxo
today on long island we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of ms i was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the state of the union 
crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled ms gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities and democrats in congress refuse to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as catchandrelease democrats must abandon their resistance 
thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in bethpage new york keep up the great work 
great to be in new york for the day heading back to the now lots of work to be done 
will be interviewed on tomorrow morning at am enjoy
clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign large dollars were paid to the spy far beyond normal starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in us history spygate a terrible thing
not surprisingly the great men women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi 
sadly i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong un 
it was my great honor to host a roundtable re ms yesterday in bethpage new york democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent lives 
i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june th while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the world 
today it was my honor to sign the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act read more 
today it was my great honor to present the to seal master chief special warfare operator britt slabinski in the east room of the full ceremony 
the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing partys campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be but what about an informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the russian hoax
can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain and to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money lost
everyone knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spywidespread spying involving multiple people mollie hemingway the federalist senior editor but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story
democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea just like they are coming to the defense of ms thugs saying that they are individuals must be nurtured or asking to end your big tax cuts raise your taxes instead dems have lost touch
very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea we will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace only time and talent will tell
today it was my great honor to deliver the commencement address at the united states in annapolis maryland congratulations good luck godspeed and anchors aweigh 
on behalf of the american people congratulations we love you 
to the class of i say we know you are up to the task we know you will make us proud we know that glory will be yours because you are winners you are warriors you are fighters you are champions and you will lead us to victory god bless the usa 
chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just wont let them do their job the killings are at a record pace and tough police work which chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stop
funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they dont even know what the deals are and when for years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states lost almost billionyear under o
senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase us parts and pay a billion fine dems do nothing
but complain and obstruct they made only bad deals iran and their socalled trade deals are the laughing stock of the world
we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which if it does happen will likely remain in singapore on the same date june th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date
good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela should be landing in dc this evening and be in the white house with his family at about pm the great people of utah will be very happy
put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the us catch and release lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall democrats are protecting ms thugs
looking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house the great people of utah are celebrating
thanks to very brave teacher hero jason seaman of noblesville indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world
unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to how to deal with north koreaand if there was it wouldnt matter the has called me wrong right from the beginning
the failing quotes a senior white house official who doesnt exist as saying even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on june would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed wrong again use real people not phony sources
with spies or informants as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but its not all over my campaign even from a very early date why didnt the crooked highest levels of the fbi or justice contact me to tell me of the phony russia problem
this whole russia probe is rigged just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that havent been lost in decades angry democrats and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for years conflicts of interest
when will the angry democrats those who worked for president o reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest its been a long time now will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems justice fbi russia
welcome home josh 
whos going to give back the young and beautiful lives and others that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt they journeyed down to washington dc with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationthey went back home in tatters
fantastic to have great men women of rolling thunder in dc showing their patriotism they love our country they love our flag they stand for our national anthem thanks to executive director artie muller
why didnt the angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton many crimes much collusion with russia why didnt the fbi take the server from the dnc rigged investigation
our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day kim jong un agrees with me on this it will happen
why didnt president obama do something about the socalled russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didnt want to upset the apple cart he was in charge not me and did nothing
 twittercomiohcuhidq
happy memorial day those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever women in years rebuilding our military and so much more nice
the president deserves some answers in discussing spygate
sally yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the justice dept i find her actions to be really quite unbelievable jonathan turley
we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation that raises legitimate questions i just find this really oddthis goes to the heart of our electoral system jonathan turley on 
thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance we are gathered here on the sacred soil of cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of america's greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom twittercomysyahfbnu
the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty 
our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served they cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families they inspired their communities 
a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts no chance this is too good to be true for republicansremember the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms gang membersnot good
california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems along with so many others on june th vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox a really good and highly competent man hell make california great again
democrats mistakenly tweet pictures from obamas term showing children from the border in steel cages they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of countrybipartisan bill
we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea meetings are currently taking place concerning summit and more kim young chol the vice chairman of north korea heading now to new york solid response to my letter thank you
this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about it wasnt just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the trump campaignpeople call that spyingthis is unprecedented and scandalous mollie hemingway
the angry democrats plus people who worked years for obama working on the rigged russia witch hunt will be meddling with the midterm elections especially now that republicans stay tough are taking the lead in polls there was no collusion except by the democrats
why arent the angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton its a rigged witch hunt thats why ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration
sorry ive got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear bad trade deals va choice the economy rebuilding the military and so much more and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clintonrussiafbijusticeobamacomeylynch etc
the fake mainstream media has from the time i announced i was running for president run the most highly sophisticated dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics no matter how well we do they find fault but the forgotten men women won im president
reptrey gowdy i dont think so i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward if i were the president and i picked someone to be the countrys
chief law enforcement officer and they told me later oh by the way im not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office i would be frustrated tooand thats how i read that senator sessions why didnt you tell me before i picked you
there are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else and i wish i did
the failing and corrupt estimated the crowd last night at people when in fact it was many times that number and the arena was rockin this is the way they demean and disparage they are very dishonest people who dont get me and never did
bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that abc does not tolerate comments like those made by roseanne barr gee he never called president donald j trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc maybe i just didnt get the call
today i am proud to keep another promise to the american people as i sign the legislation into law 
with the law i signed today patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions these are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise 
moments ago it was my great honor to sign into law 
great meeting with today talked about prison reform and sentencing 
there is no one better to represent the people of ny and staten island a place i know very well than who is strong on borders crime loves our military our vets voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again dan has my full endorsement
very importantly will win for the republicans in novemberand his opponent will not remember alabama we cant take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat
the soon to be released book the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump written by gregg jarrett looks like a real deal big hit the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see out in weeks
the recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states joe digenova former us attorney
rush limbaugh if the fbi was so concerned and if they werent targeting trump they should have told trump if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign hoax then why not try to stop it why not tell trump because they were pushing this scam
iger where is my call of apology you and abc have offended millions of people and they demand a response how is brian ross doing he tanked the market with an abc lie yet no apology double standard
the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people spies informants into my campaign surveillance much
not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true
very good meetings with north korea
will be giving a full pardon to dinesh dsouza today he was treated very unfairly by our government
fair trade
ap has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over million and going up fast no collusion except by the democrats
why arent they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show a total double standard but thats ok we are winning and will be doing so for a long time to come
looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at this morning
canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time highly restrictive on trade they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers they report a really high surplus on trade with us do timber lumber in us
today it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the united states coast guard 
we ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are neil irwin of the 
john brennan no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar not only is he a liar hes a liar about being a liar dan bongino on 
 million spent its a scam investigation americans are being worked we now know there was russian collusion with russians and the democrats the mueller team is stacked with antitrumpers who actually represented clinton people gave s to crooked h dan bongino
now this is a record that will never be broken 
very surprised that china would be doing this 
real is doing great fake news cnn is dead 
there was no collusion with russia except by the democrats when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end so bad for our country is the special counseljustice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media should be looking at dems corruption instead
the united states must at long last be treated fairly on trade if we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us or even percent to sell ours it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated that is not free or fair trade it is stupid trade
why is it that the wall street journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the us by other countries or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into us coffers
when youre almost billion dollars a year down on trade you cant lose a trade war the us has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade time to get smart
jesse watters the only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house so true
as only one of two people left who could become president why wouldnt the fbi or department of justice have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort on charges that were years old and had been previously dropped during my campaign should have told me
paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time he represented ronald reagan bob dole many others over the years but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldnt have been hired
mark penn why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff why is there an independent counsel to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics almost a disgrace
this is my th day in office and we have accomplished a lot many believe more than any president in his first days massive tax regulation cuts military vets lower crime illegal immigration stronger borders judgeships best economy jobs ever and much more
we had repeal replace done and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars except for one person but it is getting done anyway individual mandate is gone and great less expensive plans will be announced this month drug prices coming down right to try
this is the best time ever to look for a job james freeman of wsj
as has been stated by numerous legal scholars i have the absolute right to pardon myself but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong in the meantime the never ending witch hunt led by very angry and conflicted democrats others continues into the midterms
china already charges a tax of on soybeans canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products not acceptable
the us has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win
farmers have not been doing well for years mexico canada china and others have treated them unfairly by the time i finish trade talks that will change big trade barriers against us farmers and other businesses will finally be broken massive trade deficits no longer
the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong
 of american greatness 
the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt
in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job
big supreme court ruling for baker just out
the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling sorry

the russian witch hunt hoax continues all because jeff sessions didnt tell me he was going to recuse himselfi would have quickly picked someone else so much time and money wasted so many lives ruinedand sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion
meeting in singapore with north korea will hopefully be the start of something bigwe will soon see
 and champion were recently at the white house it was a great day for a great sport
separating families at the border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the democrats border security laws should be changed but the dems cant get their act together started the wall

wow strzokpage the incompetent corrupt fbi lovers have texts referring to a counterintelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december spygate is in full force is the mainstream media interested yet big stuff
great interview by with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counterintelligence operation into the trump campaign spygate at the highest level who would believe
chris farrell judicial watch they were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the us these are all violations of law this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election theres nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system
this is a level of criminality beyond the pale this is such a grave abuse of power and authority its like nothing else weve seen in our history this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
the greatest witch hunt in political history
mitch mcconnell announced he will cancel the senates august recess great maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes we need border security
great night for republicans congratulations to john cox on a really big number in california he can win even fake news cnn said the trump impact was really big much bigger than they ever thought possible so much for the big blue wave it may be a big red wave working hard
gold star father ceejay metcalf whose great son michael was just honored at the white house was fantastic this morning on he is a special man
the fake news media has been so unfair and vicious to my wife and our great first lady melania during her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death to facelift to left the wh and me for ny or virginia to abuse all fake she is doing really well
four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever fake news is really bad
many more republican voters showed up yesterday than the fake news thought possible the political pundits just dont get what is going on out there or they do get it but refuse to report the facts remember dems are high tax high crime easy to beat
congratulations to dana rohrabacher on his big california win we are proud of you dana

good luck to alice johnson have a wonderful life
alan dershowitz harvard law professor it all proves that we never needed a special counselall of this could have been done by the justice dept dont need a multimillion dollar group of people with a target on someones back not the way justice should operate so true
when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the angry democrats plus working on the witch hunt hoax there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election where is the server
how could jeff flake who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight and who doesnt have a clue think about running for office even a lower one again lets face it hes a flake
looking forward to seeing my friend prime minister of japan at noon will be discussing north korea and trade

when will people start saying thank you mr president for firing james comey
the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states this is totally illegal perhaps we could get the angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this matter as comey would call it investigate

pm abe and i are also working to improve the trading relationship between the us and japan something we have to do the us seeks a bilateral deal with japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity were working hard to reduce our trade imbalance 
great day of meetings with prime minister of japan 
please tell prime minister trudeau and president macron that they are charging the us massive tariffs and create nonmonetary barriers the eu trade surplus with the us is billion and canada keeps our farmers and others out look forward to seeing them tomorrow
prime minister trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the us and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other thingsbut he doesnt bring up the fact that they charge us up to on dairy hurting our farmers killing our agriculture
why isnt the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and nonmonetary trade barriers against the us totally unfair to our farmers workers companies take down your tariffs barriers or we will more than match you
obama schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea and now weak on crime high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up schumer failed with north korea and iran we dont need his advice
canada charges the us a tariff on dairy products they didnt tell you that did they not fair to our farmers
looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the g countries if it doesnt happen we come out even better
congratulations to the washington capitals on their great play and winning the stanley cup championship alex ovechkin the team captain was spectacular a true superstar dc is popping in many ways what a time

just met the new prime minister of italy a really great guy he will be honored in washington at the shortly he will do a great job the people of italy got it right
just left the summit in beautiful canada great meetings and relationships with the six country leaders especially since they know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to
usa trade they fully understand where i am coming from after many decades fair and reciprocal trade will happen
the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers workers and companies while sending their product into our country tax free we have put up with trade abuse for many decades and that is long enough
i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jongun will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before
create peace and great prosperity for his land i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this onetime opportunity will not be wasted
based on justins false statements at his news conference and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our us farmers workers and companies i have instructed our us reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the us market
pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that us tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around very dishonest weak our tariffs are in response to his of on dairy
fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal according to a canada release they make almost billion dollars in trade with us guess they were bragging and got caught minimum is b tax dairy from us at then justin acts hurt when called out
why should i as president of the united states allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses as they have for decades while our farmers workers taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay not fair to the people of america billion trade deficit
and add to that the fact that the us pays close to the entire cost of natoprotecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade they pay only a fraction of the costand laugh the european union had a billion surplusshould pay much more for military
germany pays slowly of gdp towards nato while we pay of a much larger gdp does anybody believe that makes sense we protect europe which is good at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on trade change is coming
great to be in singapore excitement in the air
sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on trade anymore we must put the american worker first
thank you prime minister lee hsien loong

i want to thank chairman kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people our unprecedented meeting the first between an american president and a leader of north korea proves that real change is possible 
the world has taken a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe no more rocket launches nuclear testing or research the hostages are back home with their families thank you to chairman kim our day together was historic
a year ago the pundits talking heads people that couldnt do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace please meet dont go to war now that we meet and have a great relationship with kim jong un the same haters shout out you shouldnt meet do not meet
my political representatives didnt want me to get involved in the mark sanford primary thinking that sanford would easily win but with a few hours left i felt that katie was such a good candidate and sanford was so bad i had to give it a shot congrats to katie arrington
robert de niro a very low iq individual has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies i watched him last night and truly believe he may be punchdrunk i guess he doesnt

before taking office people were assuming that we were going to war with north korea president obama said that north korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem no longer sleep well tonight
we save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith which both sides are
the us together with mexico and canada just got the world cup congratulations a great deal of hard work
oil prices are too high opec is at it again not good

the republican party is starting to show very big numbers people are starting to see what is being done results are speaking loudly north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way
now that i am back from singapore where we had a great result with respect to north korea the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime
so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak comey classified information so that a special councel will be appointed and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news
the sleazy new york democrats and their now disgraced and run out of town ag eric schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in and gave out to charity more money than it took in i wont settle this case
schneiderman who ran the clinton campaign in new york never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost years now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle
happy rd birthday to the thank you for your bravery sacrifices and dedication to the usa we love you

fbi agent peter strzok who headed the clinton russia investigations texted to his lover lisa page in the ig report that well stop candidate trump from becoming president doesnt get any lower than that

usa jobs numbers are the best in years if my opponent the democrats had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy and jobs would have been a disaster
wow the highest rated by far morning show is on the front lawn of the white house maybe ill have to take an unannounced trip down to see them
why in the world didnt barack obama fire this guy comey asks mark levin
donald trump was right to fire james comey mark levin
the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall end catch release visa lottery and chain and go to merit based immigration go for it win
wow what a tough sentence for paul manafort who has represented ronald reagan bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns didnt know manafort was the head of the mob what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others very unfair
ive had to beat very talented people including the bush dynasty then i had to beat the clinton dynasty and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig reportand never forget the fake news media it never ends
i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany but the fake news media only shows the bad photos implying anger of negotiating an agreement where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for 
the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the in canada they are once again wrong 
great discussions with european union commission president jeanclaude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the in canada last week 
democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation for a change this is why we need more republicans elected in november democrats are good at only three things high taxes high crime and obstruction sad
my supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country as we get stronger so does our country best numbers ever
the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history
chuck schumer said the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat thank you chuck but are you sure you got that right no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites hostages already back hero remains coming home much more
please clear up the fake news 
daniel henninger of the wall street journal this ig report makes it clear as did rod rosensteins memo that trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing jim comey so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now witch hunt
funny how the fake news in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i met thats because thats all they have to disparage we got so much for peace in the world more is being added in finals even got our hostagesremains
holding back the war games during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation also quite provocative can start up immediately if talks break down which i hope will not happen
the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia they are so happy over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win even if it does save potentially millions millions of lives
our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been companies doing really well and moving back to america and jobs numbers are the best in years
washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isnt paying them enough i think a really long strike would be a great idea employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time is a registered lobbyist
witch hunt there was no russian collusion oh i see there was no russian collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax too bad they didnt look at crooked hillary like this double standard
why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media they are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people fake news they put their own spin on it truth doesnt matter to them
why was the fbis sick loser peter strzok working on the totally discredited mueller team of angry conflicted democrats when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer lisa page that well stop trump from becoming president witch hunt
the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security safety dont wait until after the election because you are going to lose
the highest level of bias ive ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer trey gowdy on the fbis own peter strzok also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller a really sick deal isnt it
why dont the democrats give us the votes to fix the worlds worst immigration laws where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including ms coming into our country illegally
the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition crime in germany is way up big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture
we dont want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us
children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border it is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world not going to happen in the us
change the laws
it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration change the laws
if president obama who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have the fake news would have named him a national hero
comey gave strozk his marching orders mueller is comeys best friend witch hunt
i cant think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election a rigged witch huntp
crime in germany is up plus officials do not want to report these crimes since migrants were accepted others countries are even worse be smart america
if you dont have borders you dont have a country
democrats are the problem they dont care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like ms they cant win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters
we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally of the children are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions
 now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security

its the democrats fault they wont give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation they want open borders which breeds horrible crime republicans want security but i am working on something it never ends
fbi texts have revealed antitrump bias big news but the fake news doesnt want to cover total corruption the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly too big a story
more records 
had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford i have never been a fan of his

democrats fix the laws dont resist we are doing a far better job than bush and obama but we need strength and security at the border cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our country strong borders no crime
we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country when somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order most children come without parents
our immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to make america great again

the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders i always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside
i have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi although i do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on but you do have to ask why the doj fbi arent giving over requested documents
such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the obama administration and ours actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama fake news is working overtime
hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the us illegally children brought back to their country
if this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in its tracks and at very little by comparison cost this is the only real answer and we must continue to build the wall

early this year harleydavidson said they would move much of their plant operations in kansas city to thailand that was long before tariffs were announced hence they were just using tariffstrade war as an excuse shows how unbalanced unfair trade is but we will fix it
we are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies we are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint they must play fair or they will pay tariffs
when i had harleydavidson officials over to the white house i chided them about tariffs in other countries like india being too high companies are now coming back to america harley must know that they wont be able to sell back into us without paying a big tax
we are finishing our study of tariffs on cars from the eu in that they have long taken advantage of the us in the form of trade barriers and tariffs in the end it will all even out and it wont take very long

congress must pass smart fast and reasonable immigration laws now law enforcement at the border is doing a great job but the laws they are forced to work with are insane when people with or without children enter our country they must be told to leave without our

big decision will soon be made on our next justice of the supreme court
public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the special counsel because the public understands that there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation that the only collusion was with the dems

europe far more than it does the us by some accounts the us is paying for of nato with many countries nowhere close to their commitment on top of this the european union has a trade surplus of million with the us with big trade barriers on us goods no
i have long heard that the most important decision a us president can make is the selection of a supreme court justice will be announced tonight at pm
i have confidence that kim jong un will honor the contract we signed even more importantly our handshake we agreed to the denuclearization of north korea china on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on chinese tradehope not
the failing ny times fake news story today about breast feeding must be called out the us strongly supports breast feeding but we dont believe women should be denied access to formula many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty

i am on air force one flying to nato and hear reports that the fbi lovers peter strzok and lisa page are getting cold feet on testifying about the rigged witch hunt headed by angry democrats and people that worked for obama for years total disgrace
informing the republican senators of my nomination of judge brett kavanaugh twittercomocaavatqt
many countries in nato which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made will they reimburse the us
a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans especially hispanics feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama
the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe us has a billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through nato and nicely pay for it just doesnt work
just talked with pfizer ceo and on our drug pricing blueprint pfizer is rolling back price hikes so american patients dont pay more we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same great news for the american people
bilateral breakfast with nato secretary general in brussels belgium

democrats in congress must no longer obstruct vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now i am watching what is going on from europe it would be soooo simple to fix judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works they are just using children
what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy why are there only out of countries that have met their commitment the us is paying for europes protection then loses billions on trade must pay of gdp immediately not by 
if the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks dont obstruct and resist but rather do it the good ol fashioned way win elections
exfbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress wow but is anybody really surprised together with her lover fbi agent peter strzok she worked on the rigged witch hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever
how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former fbi agentlover peter strzok read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear
billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year at my request but it isnt nearly enough us spends too much europes borders are bad pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable
as i head out to a very important nato meeting i see that fbi loveragent lisa page is dodging a subpoena is refusing to show up and testify what can she possibly say about her statements and lies so much corruption on the other side where is the attorney general 
presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia they pay only a fraction of their cost the us pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe and loses big on trade
on top of it all germany just started paying russia the country they want protection from billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia not acceptable all nato nations must meet their commitment and that must ultimately go to 
 press conference in brussels belgium

where is the dnc server and why didnt the fbi take possession of it deep state
the stories you heard about the russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administration why didnt they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election
so funny i just checked out fake news cnn for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta actually a nice guy they didnt but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin fake news
remember it was little jeff z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said i could not win the election in that there was no way to over over again in the electoral college i got they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage still hurting
our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in japan we commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones 
these russian individuals did their work during the obama years why didnt obama do something about it because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win thats why had nothing to do with the trump administration but fake news doesnt want to report the truth as usual
there hasnt been a missile or rocket fired in months in north korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isnt the fake news talking about these wonderful facts because it is fake news
heading to helsinki finland looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow unfortunately no matter how well i do at the summit if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia
over the years i would return to criticism that it wasnt good enough that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems
know how to do is resist and obstruct this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country but at some point it will heal

received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present future we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media nato is now strong rich
president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling he said it couldnt happen was no big deal did nothing about it when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok
our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of us foolishness and stupidity and now the rigged witch hunt
it was an honor to join you this morning thank you 
joint press conference from helsinki finland

i had a great meeting with nato they have paid billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future only because of me nato was weak but now it is strong again bad for russia the media only says i was rude to leaders never mentions the money
while i had a great meeting with nato raising vast amounts of money i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia sadly it is not being reported that way the fake news is going crazy
thank you the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations whats he supposed to think
the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before
the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success except in the fake news media

prosperity is returning donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern american history thank you to the great lou dobbs
so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match big results will come
while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success many positive things will come out of that meeting
russia has agreed to help with north korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along there is no rush the sanctions remain big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process
congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress my endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve enjoy
a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming we could have growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again 
some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia they would rather go to war than see this its called trump derangement syndrome
 million jobs created since our great election victory far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition
brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia the primary is on tuesday brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment i give him my full and total endorsement

thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs likewise to pfizer we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs
the democrats have a death wish in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ice this should cost them heavily in the midterms yesterday the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice
the fake news media is going crazy they make up stories without any backup sources or proof many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity but ill complain anyway
the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia even a confrontation that could lead to war they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that ill probably have a good relationship with putin we are doing much better than any other country
trump recognized russian meddling many times thank you to and for actually showing the clips the fake news wants no part of that narrative too bad they dont want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set
really big jobs meeting today at the white house pm
i told you so the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies google they truly have taken advantage of the us but not for long
the summit with russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the fake news media i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for israel nuclear
proliferation cyber attacks trade ukraine middle east peace north korea and more there are many answers some easy and some hard to these problemsbut they can all be solved
trump recognized russian meddling many times 
will the dems and fake news ever learn this is classic 
my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri such a tragedy such a great loss may god be with you all
china the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the us is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge as usual not a level playing field
the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well tightening now hurts all that we have done the us should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals debt coming due we are raising rates really
farmers have been on a downward trend for years the price of soybeans has fallen since years before the election a big reason is bad terrible trade deals with other countries they put on massive tariffs and barriers canada charges on dairy farmers will win
so important should have been done years ago 
i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin in the old days they would call it diplomacy if i was loud vicious i would have been criticized for being too tough remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim hypocrites
the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again cant believe it isnt it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart the commissioner must now make a stand first time kneeling out for game second time kneeling out for seasonno pay
inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyers office early in the morning almost unheard of even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of perhaps illegal the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong
the rigged witch hunt headed by the angry democrats and now more have been added one who worked directly for obama wh seems intent on damaging the republican partys chances in the november election this democrat excuse for losing the election never ends
no collusion no obstruction but that doesnt matter because the angry democrats who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing
brian kemp who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with vp brian is very strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and the nd amendment he will be a great governor
troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime borders troy is the total opposite and loves our military vets nd amendment early voting just started with election day on august th troy has my full total endorsement
congratulations to and on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of justice and fbi misled the courts witch hunt rigged a scam
looking more more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam
andrew mccarthy i said this could never happen this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it it is so bad it screams out at you on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt
 on source was the fake dossier yes the dirty dossier paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump and looking for information that could discredit candidate trump carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign illegal
i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it so bad for our country
happy birthday 
so president obama knew about russia before the election why didnt he do something about it why didnt he tell our campaign because it is all a big hoax thats why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win
to iranian president rouhani never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence death be cautious
tom fitton on at am now judicial watch
so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt
it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump
and the doj fbi and obama gang need to be held to account source was the major source avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team not about carter pagewas all about getting trump
carter page wasnt a spy wasnt an agent of the russians he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump tom fitton a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now
when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin and all that i gave up remember i gave up nothing we merely talked about future benefits for both countries also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the corrupt media
a rocket has not been launched by north korea in months likewise no nuclear tests japan is happy all of asia is happy but the fake news is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that i am angry because it is not going fast enough wrong very happy
the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the us supreme court two months ago next up is the us post office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a big percentage of their packages
in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for amazon is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought
robert will do a great job for our vets we also recently won choice 
lou barletta was one of my first supporters he is tough on crime and borders will be a great senator from pennsylvania his opponent is weak on crime ice and borders we need lou 
 showcase 
countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never
tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs its as simple as that and everybodys talking remember we are the piggy bank thats being robbed all will be great
today is the day to vote for brian kemp will be great for georgia full endorsement 
our country is doing great best financial numbers on the planet great to have usa winning again

the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade i have an idea for them both the us and the eu drop all tariffs barriers and subsidies that would finally be called free market and fair trade hope they do it we are ready but they wont
so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldnt approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved much bigger but not sinclair disgraceful
the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton frame donald trump is a hot seller already number one more importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly congratulations to gregg jarrett
every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs i wonder what can they be thinking are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off lost billion on trade last year no weakness
when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity negotiations are going really well be cool the end result will be worth it
china is targeting our farmers who they know i love respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the us they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice until now china made billion on us last year
what kind of a lawyer would tape a client so sad is this a first never heard of it before why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while i was presumably saying positive things i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad
congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night wow those are big numbers now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you she is weak on vets the military and the nd amendment win

great meeting on trade today with and representatives of the european union we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies work on documents has already started and the process is moving
along quickly european union nations will be open to the united states and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them there was great warmth and feeling in the room a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible
obviously the european union as represented by and the united states as represented by yours truly love each other 
thank you georgia they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from points down to a to victory two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to brian

 a brilliant lawyer who although a liberal democrat who probably didnt vote for me has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way he has written a new and very important book

america is open for business and us steel is back 
the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states after so many years this will be a great moment for so many families thank you to kim jong un
way to go jerry this is what the league should do 
arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major us steel plant in granite city illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion
the only collusion with russia was with the democrats so now they are looking at my tweets along with million other people the rigged witch hunt continues how stupid and unfair to our countryand so the fake news doesnt waste my time with dumb questions no
i did not know of the meeting with my son don jr sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam taxi cabs maybe he even retained bill and crooked hillarys lawyer gee i wonder if they helped him make the choice
great gdp numbers just released will be having a news conference soon

do you think the fake news media will ever report on this tweet from michael 
please understand there are consequences when people cross our border illegally whether they have children or not and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes congress must act on fixing the dumbest worst immigration laws anywhere in the world vote r
had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with ag sulzberger publisher of the new york times spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media how that fake news has morphed into phrase enemy of the people sad
the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for african americans hispanics asians and women
i would be willing to shut down government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall must get rid of lottery catch release etc and finally go to system of immigration based on merit we need great people coming into our country
when the media driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk very unpatriotic freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news
accurately of media coverage of my administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving its no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low i will not allow our great country to be sold out by antitrump haters in the
dying newspaper industry no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people as an example the failing new york times
and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change
there is no collusion the robert mueller rigged witch hunt headed now by increased from including an obama white house lawyer angry democrats was started by a fraudulent dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc therefore the witch hunt is an illegal scam
is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump including the fact that we had a very nasty contentious business relationship i turned him down to head the fbi one day before appointment as sc comey is his close friend
also why is mueller only appointing angry dems some of whom have worked for crooked hillary others including himself have worked for obamaand why isnt mueller looking at all of the criminal activity real russian collusion on the democrats sidepodesta dossier
we must have border security get rid of chain lottery catch release sanctuary cities go to merit based immigration protect ice and law enforcement and of course keep building but much faster the wall

the globalist koch brothers who have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade i never sought their support because i dont need their money or bad ideas they love my tax regulation cuts judicial picks more i made
them richer their network is highly overrated i have beaten them at every turn they want to protect their companies outside the us from being taxed im for america first the american worker a puppet for no one two nice guys with bad ideas make america great again
rush limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it
one of the reasons we need great border security is that mexicos murder rate in increased by to people killed a record the democrats want open borders i want maximum border security and respect for ice and our great law enforcement professionals 
collusion is not a crime but that doesnt matter because there was no collusion except by crooked hillary and the democrats
i am looking into d plastic guns being sold to the public already spoke to nra doesnt seem to make much sense
will be in tampa tonight a big year for who will be a great governor for florida strong on crime borders and our nd amendment big help on tax regulation cuts loves our military our vets has my full total endorsement
the fake news media is going crazy they are totally unhinged and in many ways after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people i enjoy watching in years when i am no longer in office their ratings will dry up and they will be gone
congressman david kustoff has been a champion for the trump agenda i greatly appreciate his support david is strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and second amendment get out and vote for david on thursday august nd he has my full and total endorsement
 has a primary on august st he doesnt need any help because he is absolutely outstanding in every way but i hope the great people of wyoming will go out and show their support anyway john is absolutely top of the line has my complete total endorsement
i dont care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the democrats will allow it to be fixed without a government shutdown
border security is national security and national security is the longterm viability of our country a government shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and prosperous america
worker pay rate hits highest level since 
on my way to tampa florida look forward to seeing everyone soon 
thank you florida i love you 
fbi agent peter strzok on the mueller team should have recused himself on day one he was out to stop the election of donald trump he needed an insurance policy those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the election he should never ever been allowed to
remain in the fbi while he himself was being investigated this is a real issue it wont go into a mueller report because mueller is going to protect these guys mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation alan dershowitz
this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further bob mueller is totally conflicted and his angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa
paul manafort worked for ronald reagan bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders he worked for me for a very short time why didnt government tell me that he was under investigation these old charges have nothing to do with collusion a hoax
russian collusion with the trump campaign one of the most successful in history is a total hoax the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was along with comey mccabe strzok and his lover the lovely lisa page used to begin the witch hunt disgraceful
looking back on history who was treated worse alfonse capone legendary mob boss killer and public enemy number one or paul manafort political operative reagandole darling now serving solitary confinement although convicted of nothing where is the russian collusion
we already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad marc thiessen washington post
it was my great honor to be joined by leading pastors and faith leaders from across our nation today at the

tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated china market has dropped in last months and they are talking to us our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible trade deals are successfully renegotiated america first
tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry plants are opening all over the us steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our treasury other countries use tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream
tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today only fools would disagree we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs we win either way
china which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and pr trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on tariffs because they are really hurting their economy likewise other countries we are winning but must be strong

the fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know its true i am providing a great service by explaining this to the american people they purposely cause great division distrust they can also cause war they are very dangerous sick
tariffs are working big time every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the us always to our detriment i say as they cometax them if they dont want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the us in either event it means jobs and great wealth
because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the obama administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people at minimum we will make much better trade deals for our country
fake news reporting a complete fabrication that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son donald had in trump tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere i did not know about it
why arent mueller and the angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj this is the most one sided witch hunt in the history of our country fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast
too bad a large portion of the media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the rigged witch hunt but that is why we call them fake news
presidential approval numbers are very good strong economy military and just about everything else better numbers than obama at this point by far we are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a blue wave but there might be a red wave
collusion with russia was very real hillary clinton and her team colluded with the russians and so did adam schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was russians to obtain compromising material on djt we also know that hillary clinton paid through
a law firm eventually kremlin connected sources to gather info on donald trump collusion is very real with russia but only with hillary and the democrats and we should demand a full investigation dan bongino on looking forward to the new ig report
great financial numbers being announced on an almost daily basis economy has never been better jobs at best point in history fixing our terrible trade deals is a priorityand going very well immigration on merit based system to take care of the companies coming back to usa

there has been no evidence whatsoever that donald trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the election in fact the evidence is the opposite that hillary clinton the democrats colluded with the russians to fix the election 
this is an illegally brought rigged witch hunt run by people who are totally corrupt andor conflicted it was started and paid for by crooked hillary and the democrats phony dossier fisa disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired angry dems stay tuned

congressman ted yoho of florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total endorsement tough on crime and borders ted was really helpful on tax cuts vote all the way for ted in the upcoming primary he will never let you down
 why didnt the fbi tell president trump that they had concerns about carter page is there a double standard here they told senator diane feinstein that she had a spy but not trump is that entrapment or did they just want to use page as an excuse to spy
jenna ellis fbi thought they wouldnt get caught because they thought that hillary was going to win there is overt bias and that depends on whether you are democrat or republican a double standard that needs to stop
 no evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between donald trump and the russians and here we are a year and a half later
the nfl players are at it again taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the national anthem numerous players from different teams wanted to show their outrage at something that most of them are unable to define they make a fortune doing what they love

why isnt the fbi giving andrew mccabe text messages to judicial watch or appropriate governmental authorities fbi said they wont give up even one i may have to get involved do not destroy what are they hiding mccabe wife took big campaign dollars from hillary people
will the fbi ever recover its once stellar reputation so badly damaged by comey mccabe peter s and his lover the lovely lisa page and other top officials now dismissed or fired so many of the great men and women of the fbi have been hurt by these clowns and losers
the riots in charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division we must come together as a nation i condemn all types of racism and acts of violence peace to all americans
i am proud to have fought for and secured the lowest african american and hispanic unemployment rates in history now im pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance i will never stop fighting for all americans
the big story that the fake news media refuses to report is lowlife christopher steeles many meetings with deputy ag bruce ohr and his beautiful wife nelly it was fusion gps that hired steele to write the phony discredited dossier paid for by crooked hillary the dnc
do you believe nelly worked for fusion and her husband still works for the department of justice i have never seen anything so rigged in my life our ag is scared stiff and missing in action it is all starting to be revealed not pretty ig report soon witch hunt

 bob mueller isnt your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier paid for by hillary created by a man who hates donald trump used to con a fisa court judge bob i really think its time for you to give up your phony investigation no collusion
 your paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger unemployment numbers are better than they have been in years perhaps ever our country is booming like never before and it will get even better many companies moving back to the usa
many owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas great most other companies are coming in our direction including harley competitors a really bad move us will soon have a level playing field or better
seems like the department of justice and fbi had a program to keep donald trump from becoming president if this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail this is a media coverup of the biggest story of our time
wacky omarosa who got fired times on the apprentice now got fired for the last time she never made it never will she begged me for a job tears in her eyes i said ok people in the white house hated her she was vicious but not smart i would rarely see her but heard
really bad things nasty to people would constantly miss meetings work when gen kelly came on board he told me she was a loser nothing but problems i told him to try working it out if possible because she only said great things about me until she got fired
while i know its not presidential to take on a lowlife like omarosa and while i would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and i know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even wacky omarosa look legitimate as possible sorry
the very unpopular governor of ohio and failed presidential candidate hurt troy baldersons recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate even kasichs lt governor lost gov race because of his unpopularity credit to troy on the big win
agent peter strzok was just fired from the fbi finally the list of bad players in the fbi doj gets longer longer based on the fact that strzok was in charge of the witch hunt will it be dropped it is a total hoax no collusion no obstruction i just fight back
just fired agent strzok formerly of the fbi was in charge of the crooked hillary clinton sham investigation it was a total fraud on the american public and should be properly redone
wacky omarosa already has a fully signed nondisclosure agreement
brooks koepka just won his third golf major and he did it not only with his powerful game but with his powerful mind he has been a man of steel on the tour and will have many victories including majors ahead of him congrats to brooks and his great team on a job well done

such wonderful and powerful things about me a true champion of civil rights until she got fired omarosa had zero credibility with the media they didnt want interviews when she worked in the white house now that she says bad about me they will talk to her fake news
tom fitton of judicial watch the strzok firing is as much about the mueller operation as anything else there would be no mueller special councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of strzok his colleagues at the top levels of the fbi we know this
guy was corrupt and had antitrump animus strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation instead mueller is pretending nothing went wrong he used strzok he used the clinton dnc dossierthe whole thing
should be shut down the strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt it should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors thank you judicial watch i couldnt have said it better myself
when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the white house i guess it just didnt work out good work by general kelly for quickly firing that dog
another terrorist attack in londonthese animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength
bruce ohr of the justice department can you believe he is still there is accused of helping disgraced christopher steele find dirt on trump ohrs wife nelly was in on the act big time worked for fusion gps on fake dossier 
they were all in on it clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump for things he didnt do gregg jarrett on if we had a real attorney general this witch hunt would never have been started looking at the wrong people
fired fbi agent peter strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started there was no collusion or obstruction with russia and everybody including the democrats know it the only collusion and obstruction was by crooked hillary the democrats and the dnc
strzok started the illegal rigged witch hunt why isnt this socalled probe ended immediately why arent these angry and conflicted democrats instead looking at crooked hillary
lou dobbs this cannot go forwardthis special counsel with all of his conflicts with his angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia the dems are the ones who should be investigated thank you lou so true

the rigged russian witch hunt goes on and on as the originators and founders of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity all credibility is gone from this terrible hoax and much more will be lost as it proceeds no collusion
the action the strzok firing was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as comeys skinny inner circle chris swecker former fbi assistant director
happy birthday to the leader of the democrat party maxine waters
our country was built on tariffs and tariffs are now leading us to great new trade deals as opposed to the horrible and unfair trade deals that i inherited as your president other countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great usa no longer
chuck schumer i agree 
john brennan is a stain on the country we deserve better than this former secret service agent and author of new book spygate the attempted sabotage of donald j trump dan bongino thank you dan and good luck with the book
hillary clinton clearly got a pass by the fbi we have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame donald trump concerning the rigged witch hunt joe digenova former us attorney
were not going to make america great again it was never that great can you believe this is the governor of the highest taxed state in the us andrew cuomo having a total meltdown
mark levin when they had power they didnt stop the russians the chinese the north koreans they funded the iranians are responsible for the greatest scandal in american history by interfering with our election trying to undermine the trump campaign and trump presidency
id strip the whole bunch of them theyre all corrupt theyve all abused their power theyve all betrayed the american people with a political agenda they tried to steal and influence an election in the united states 
our economy is doing better than ever money is pouring into our cherished dollar like rarely before companies earnings are higher than ever inflation is low business optimism is higher than it has ever been for the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers
the fake news media is the opposition party it is very bad for our great countrybut we are winning
the boston globe which was sold to the the failing new york times for billion dollars plus million dollars in losses investment or billion dollars was then sold by the times for dollar now the globe is in collusion with other papers on free press prove it
there is nothing that i would want more for our country than true freedom of the press the fact is that the press is free to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is fake news pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people honesty wins
the queen of soul aretha franklin is dead she was a great woman with a wonderful gift from god her voice she will be missed
great meeting today at the 
thank you for the kind words omarosa 
turkey has taken advantage of the united states for many years they are now holding our wonderful christian pastor who i must now ask to represent our country as a great patriot hostage we will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on turkey
the fbi received documents from bruce ohr of the justice department whose wife nelly worked for fusion gps disgraced and fired fbi agent peter strzok this is too crazy to be believed the rigged witch hunt has zero credibility
while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a russian oligarch catherine herridge of in other words they were colluding with russia
very concerned about comeys firing afraid they will be exposed said bruce ohr dojs emails notes show bruce ohrs connection to phony discredited trump dossier a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act rigged witch hunt
 speaking of john brennan how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place now that is a really good question then followed by richard blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war hero so true a total fake
how can senator richard blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam pass judgement on anyone loser
an incredibly corrupt fbi doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election brennan has gone off the deep end hes disgraced and discredited himself his conduct has been outrageous chris farrell judicial watch
director brennans recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power if director brennans statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia why didnt he include it in the intelligence community assessment
released in if his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach richard burr rnc senate intel cmte chair 
in speaking with some of the worlds top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the us stop quarterly reporting go to a six month system said one that would allow greater flexibility save money i have asked the sec to study
how does a politician cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the us survive making the statement were not going to make america great again it was never that great which section of the sentence is worse
the local politicians who run washington dc poorly know a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it never let someone hold you up i will instead
attend the big parade already scheduled at andrews air force base on a different date go to the paris parade celebrating the end of the war on november th maybe we will do something next year in dc when the cost comes way down now we can buy some more jet fighters
just announced youth unemployment is at a year low 
the us has more than double the growth rate than it had months ago
wow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about americas lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better andrew choked badly mistake
when a politician admits that were not going to make america great again there doesnt seem to be much reason to ever vote for him this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo with many wanting him to resignhe will get higher ratings than his brother chris
which is worse hightax andrew cuomo's statement were not going to make america great again it was never that great or hillary clintons deplorables statement
i say andrews was a bigger and more incompetent blunder he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress but his political career is over
fox news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the antitrump russia probe will be exposed charles payne how much more does mueller have to see they have blinders on rigged
bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy its astonishing that hes still employed bruce nelly ohrs bank account is getting fatter fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesnt disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal
financial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation bribery statute violation honest services violationall major crimesbecause the doj is run by blank jeff sessions gregg jarrett so when does mueller do what must be done probably never 
social media is totally discriminating against republicanconservative voices speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration we wont let that happen they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right while at the same time doing nothing to others
censorship is a very dangerous thing absolutely impossible to police if you are weeding out fake news there is nothing so fake as cnn msnbc yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or dont watch at all
too many voices are being destroyed some good some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen who is making the choices because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made let everybody participate good bad and we will all just have to figure it out
all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction china but in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone
has anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director he will go down as easily the worst in history since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country
great job rachel camposduffy on 
the economy is stronger and better than ever before importantly there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time
the united states has ended the ridiculous million dollar yearly development payment to syria saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the us i want to develop the us our military and countries that help us
i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special counsel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt
the failing wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel he must be a john dean type rat but i allowed him and all others to testify i didnt have to i have nothing to hide
and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing mccarthyism at its worst yet mueller his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side media is even worse
no collusion and no obstruction except by crooked hillary and the democrats all of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction what about the brennan comey mccabe strzok lies to congress or crookeds emails
the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president when in fact it is just the opposite the two fake reporters knew this this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people so bad for america
some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times they actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward from the day i announced the times has been fake news and with their disgusting new board member it will only get worse
study the late joseph mccarthy because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby rigged witch hunt
disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone
looking for trouble they are enjoying ruining peoples lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side the lies the firings the deleted emails and soooo much more muellers angry dems are looking to impact the election they are a national disgrace
wheres the collusion they made up a phony crime called collusion and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction of a phony crime that never existed if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt they scream obstruction
i hope john brennan the worst cia director in our countrys history brings a lawsuit it will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt he wont sue
everybody wants to keep their security clearance its worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan it certainly isnt because of the good job he did he is a political hack
will bruce ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited dossier ever be fired from the jeff sessions justice department a total joke
bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multimillion dollar investigation into what apparently didnt happen darrell issa house oversight we can take out the word apparently

i have asked secretary of state mike pompeo not to go to north korea at this time because i feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula
additionally because of our much tougher trading stance with china i do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were despite the un sanctions which are in place

considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities this is not helpful nonetheless the president believes that his relationship with kim jong un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts
of money on joint ussouth korea war games besides the president can instantly start the joint exercises again with south korea and japan if he so chooses if he does they will be far bigger than ever before as for the uschina trade disputes and other
differences they will be resolved in time by president trump and chinas great president xi jinping their relationship and bond remain very strong

no information was ever given by the trump team to russia yet the hillary clinton campaign paid for information from kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary christopher steele jesse waters

middleclass income hits alltime high and will continue to rise unless the dems get in and destroy what we have built
 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit puerto rico when i left the island after the storm had hit they had anywhere from to deaths as time went by it did not go up by much then a long time later they started to report really large numbers like 
this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico if a person died for any reason like old age just add them onto the list bad politics i love puerto rico
the wall street journal has it wrong we are under no pressure to make a deal with china they are under pressure to make a deal with us our markets are surging theirs are collapsing we will soon be taking in billions in tariffs making products at home if we meet we meet

the story of puerto rico is the rebuilding that has occurred the president has done an extraordinary job of cleanup rebuilding electrical stuff and everything else the people of puerto rico have one of the most corrupt governments in our country 
my thoughts and prayers are with evelyn rodriguez this evening along with her family and friends

funny how lowly rated cnn and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to september th and the oklahoma city bombing yet when i criticize them they go wild and scream its just not presidential

the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country actually it is their fake dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand
there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open obvious hostility report the news accurately fairly that will do much to put out the flame
of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must end

unbelievably lucky to have him and im just awed at how well theyve done its all the trump magic trump is the magic man incredible hes got the entire media against him attacking him every day and he pulls out these enormous wins ben stein the capitalist code
 how do the democrats respond to this think of how his position with republicans improvesall the candidates who won tonight they realize how important he is because of what he did in campaigning for them they owe him their political career thanks i agree

those that worked with me in this incredible midterm election embracing certain policies and principles did very well those that did not say goodbye yesterday was such a very big win and all under the pressure of a nasty and hostile media
i will be doing a news conference at the white house am will be discussing our success in the midterms
to any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great midterm election just remember two words fake news
if the democrats think they are going to waste taxpayer money investigating us at the house level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of classified information and much else at the senate level two can play that game
in all fairness nancy pelosi deserves to be chosen speaker of the house by the democrats if they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some republican votes she has earned this great honor
according to nbc news voters nationwide disapprove of the socalled mueller investigation more than they approve you mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting witch hunt led by angry democrats is all about

as soon as democrats sent their best election stealing lawyer marc elias to broward county they miraculously started finding democrat votes dont worry florida i am sending much better lawyers to expose the fraud
jeff flakey doesnt want to protect the nonsenate confirmed special counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in arizona for the crime of doing a terrible job a weak and ineffective guy
rick scott was up by votes on election day now they found many votes and he is only up votes the broward effect how come they never find republican votes
mayor gillum conceded on election day and now broward county has put him back into play bill nelson conceded election now hes back in play this is an embarrassment to our country and to democracy
in the election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a number couldnt do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory
thank you for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to election theft in broward and palm beach counties the world is now watching closely
just out in arizona signatures dont match electoral corruption call for a new election we must protect our democracy
president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the us china and russia very insulting but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato which the us subsidizes greatly
matthew g whitaker is a highly respected former us attorney from iowa he was chosen by jeff sessions to be his chief of staff i did not know mr whitaker likewise as chief i did not know mr whitaker except primarily as he traveled with ag sessions no social contact

just returned from france where much was accomplished in my meetings with world leaders never easy bringing up the fact that the us must be treated fairly which it hasnt on both military and trade we pay for large portions of other countries military protection
hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade i told them that this situation cannot continue it is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the united states massive amounts
of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but trade deficits and losses it is time that these very rich countries either pay the united states for its great military protection or protect themselvesand trade must be made free and fair
the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged an honest vote count is no longer possibleballots massively infected must go with election night
the prospect of presidential harassment by the dems is causing the stock market big headaches

emmanuel macron suggests building its own army to protect europe against the us china and russia but it was germany in world wars one two how did that work out for france they were starting to learn german in paris before the us came along pay for nato or not
on trade france makes excellent wine but so does the us the problem is that france makes it very hard for the us to sell its wines into france and charges big tariffs whereas the us makes it easy for french wines and charges very small tariffs not fair must change
the problem is that emmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating in france and an unemployment rate of almost he was just trying to get onto another subject by the way there is no country more nationalist than france very proud peopleand rightfully so
make france great again
by the way when the helicopter couldnt fly to the first cemetery in france because of almost zero visibility i suggested driving secret service said no too far from airport big paris shutdown speech next day at american cemetery in pouring rain little reportedfake news

our pledge to hire american includes those leaving prison and looking for a very fresh start new job and new life the legislation i am supporting today contains many significant reforms read more here 
the white house is running very smoothly and the results for our nation are obviously very good we are the envy of the world but anytime i even think about making changes the fake news media goes crazy always seeking to make us look as bad as possible very dishonest
the inner workings of the mueller investigation are a total mess they have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts they are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want they are a disgrace to our nation and dont
care how many lives the ruin these are angry people including the highly conflicted bob mueller who worked for obama for years they wont even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side a total witch hunt like no other in american history
universities will someday study what highly conflicted and not senate approved bob mueller and his gang of democrat thugs have done to destroy people why is he protecting crooked hillary comey mccabe lisa page her lover peter s and all of his friends on the other side
the only collusion is that of the democrats with russia and many others why didnt the fbi take the server from the dnc they still dont have it check out how biased facebook google and twitter are in favor of the democrats thats the real collusion

the mayor of tijuana mexico just stated that the city is illprepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last months likewise the us is illprepared for this invasion and will not stand for it they are causing crime and big problems in mexico go home
catch and release is an obsolete term it is now catch and detain illegal immigrants trying to come into the usa often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for us asylum will be detained or turned away dems must approve border security wall now
from day one rick scott never wavered he was a great governor and will be even a greater senator in representing the people of florida congratulations to rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign
 loves mississippi and our great usa 
of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center president clinton famously missed his shot we paid pakistan billions of dollars they never told us he was living there fools
we no longer pay pakistan the billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us bin laden being a prime example afghanistan being another they were just one of many countries that take from the united states without giving anything in return thats ending
the fake news is showing old footage of people climbing over our ocean area fence this is what it really looks like no climbers anymore under our administration

great new book out mad politics keeping your sanity in a world gone crazy by loudon go out and get your copy today a great read
sorry chief justice john roberts but you do indeed have obama judges and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country it would be great if the th circuit was indeed an independent judiciary but if it is why
are so many opposing view on border and safety cases filed there and why are a vast number of those cases overturned please study the numbers they are shocking we need protection and security these rulings are making our country unsafe very dangerous and unwise
thank you to president trump on the border no american president has ever done this before hector garza national border patrol council
there are a lot of criminals in the caravan we will stop them catch and detain judicial activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger not good
 of these decisions have been overturned in the th circuit a terrible costly and dangerous disgrace it has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays much talk over dividing up the th circuit into or circuits too big
brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records whatever happened to global warming
you just cant win with the fake news media a big story today is that because i have pushed so hard and gotten gasoline prices so low more people are driving and i have caused traffic jams throughout our great nation sorry everyone
its a mean nasty world out there the middle east in particular this is a long and historic commitment one that is absolutely vital to americas national security i agree in addition many billions of dollars of purchases made in us big jobs oil
happy thanksgiving to all
justice roberts can say what he wants but the th circuit is a complete total disaster it is out of control has a horrible reputation is overturned more than any circuit in the country is used to get an almost guaranteed result judges must not legislate security
and safety at the border or anywhere else they know nothing about it and are making our country unsafe our great law enforcement professionals must be allowed to do their job if not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death we want the constitution as written
will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at am eastern then it will be off to see our coast guard patriots to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes happy thanksgiving
this is the coldest weather in the history of the thanksgiving day parade in nyc and one of the coldest thanksgivings on record
our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the border because of the judicial activism and interference by the th circuit nevertheless they are working hard to make america a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins
republicans and democrats must come together finally with a major border security package which will include funding for the wall after years of talk it is finally time for action fix the border for once and for all now
really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support mitch mcconnell and have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country already passed with big vote in house would be a major victory for all
i am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by secretary the fake news likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they arent true they never like to ask me for a quote bc it would kill their story
migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court we only will allow those who come into our country legally other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain no releasing into the us
all will stay in mexico if for any reason it becomes necessary we will close our southern border there is no way that the united states will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore
victor davis hanson was a very good and interesting guest of mark levin on he wrote a highly touted book called the second world wars and a new book will soon be coming out called the case for trump recommend both 
i will be in gulfport and tupelo mississippi on monday night doing two rallies for senator hydesmith who has a very important election on tuesday she is an outstanding person who is strong on the border crime military our great vets healthcare the nd a needed in dc
the large and violent french protests dont take into account how badly the united states has been treated on trade by the european union or on fair and reasonable payments for our great military protection both of these topics must be remedied soon
would be very smart if mexico would stop the caravans long before they get to our southern border or if originating countries would not let them form it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in us no longer dems created this problem no crossings
so great that oil prices are falling thank you president t add that which is like a big tax cut to our other good economic news inflation down are you listening fed
mississippi vote for on tuesday respected by all we need her in washington thanks
general anthony tata president trump is a man of his word he said he was going to be tough on the border and he is tough on the border he has rightfully strengthened the border in the face of an unprecedented threat its the right move by president trump thanks general
europe has to pay their fair share for military protection the european union for many years has taken advantage of us on trade and then they dont live up to their military commitment through nato things must change fast
clinton foundation donations drop which shows that they illegally played the power game they monetized their political influence through the foundation during her tenure the state department was put in the service of the clinton foundation andrew mccarthy
 did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the obama administration in fact a picture of children in jails was used by other fake media to show how bad cruel we are but it was in during o years obama separated
children from parents as did bush etc because that is the policy and law i tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the border so with obama seperation is fine but with trump its not fake minutes
mexico should move the flag waving migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are not coming into the usa we will close the border permanently if need be congress fund the wall
when mueller does his final report will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other sidewhatever happened to podesta and will he be putting in statements from

the fake news media builds bob mueller up as a saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite he is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system where he is only looking at one side and not the other heroes will come of this and it wont be mueller and his
terrible gang of angry democrats look at their past and look where they come from the now witch hunt continues and theyve got nothing but ruined lives where is the server let these terrible people go back to the clinton foundation and justice department

while the disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least major players are intimating that the angry mueller gang of dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts they will get relief this is our joseph mccarthy era
the reason that the small truck business in the us is such a go to favorite is that for many years tariffs of have been put on small trucks coming into our country it is called the chicken tax if we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here

did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime at the same time mueller and the angry democrats arent even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats a total disgrace
when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever endor will it just go on forever after wasting more than is that possible it has proven only one thingthere was no collusion with russia so ridiculous

president george hw bush led a long successful and beautiful life whenever i was with him i saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family his accomplishments were great from beginning to end he was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all
i was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the g
however out of respect for the bush family and former president george hw bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference
this week jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of hanukkah melania and i send our very best wishes for a blessed and happy hanukkah 
china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the us currently the tariff is 
my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward very good things will happen we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed level the field
farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants farmers i love you
president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all
i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race the us spent billion dollars this year crazy
we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally we will close the entire southern border if necessary also stop the drugs
michael cohen asks judge for no prison time you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc and not serve a long prison term he makes up stories to get a great already reduced deal for himself and get
his wife and fatherinlaw who has the money off scott free he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence
i will never testify against trump this statement was recently made by roger stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about president trump nice to know that some people still have guts
bob mueller who is a much different man than people think and his out of control band of angry democrats dont want the truth they only want lies the truth is very bad for their mission
looking forward to being with the bush family to pay my respects to president george hw bush
congratulations to newly inaugurated mexican president he had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the mexican people we will work well together for many years to come
 twittercomxbfylzzns
looking forward to being with the wonderful bush family at blair house today the former first lady will be coming over to the white house this morning to be given a tour of the christmas decorations by melania the elegance precision of the last two days have been remarkable
the negotiations with china have already started unless extended they will end days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin larry kudlow wilbur ross and peter navarro
on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible if it is we will get it done china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will but if not remember
i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in billions in tariffs make america rich again
but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign let the negotiations begin make america great again
could somebody please explain to the democrats we need their votes that our country losses billion dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow top border security including a wall is billion pays for itself in two months get it done
i am glad that my friend and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters
in the world i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving americas environment but american taxpayers and american workers shouldnt pay to clean up others countries pollution
we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states ultimately i believe we will be making a deal either now or into the future
china does not want tariffs
china officially echoed president donald trumps optimism over bilateral trade talks chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of us soybeans liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that
china had agreed to start immediately buying us products 
very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting all subjects discussed
one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states it will now be considered a controlled substance this could be a game changer on what is
considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all last year over people died from fentanyl if china cracks down on this horror drug using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible
looking forward to being with the bush family this is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life he will be missed
hopefully opec will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted the world does not want to see or need higher oil prices
doug wead a truly great presidential historian had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history the funeral service today of president bush doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time 
working hard thank you 
without the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years tax regulation cuts judges military vets etc my approval rating would be at rather than the just reported by rasmussen its called presidential harassment
my thoughts and prayers are with the crew members who were involved in a midair collision off the coast of japan thank you to for their immediate response and rescue efforts whatever you need we are here for you 
does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans with the very important help of my campaign rallies won the united states senate to all i hear is that the open border dems won the house senate alone approves judges others big republican win
statement from china the teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next days i agree
jerome corsi this is not justice this is not america this is a political prosecution the special prosecutor counsel to get this plea deal demanded i lie and violate the law theyre the criminals he is not alone angry dems people forced to lie sad 
trishregan did the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant i dont think so the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents dont use government resources to take down political foes weaponizing government for gain is this really america witch hunt
fake news the enemy of the people
arizona together with our military and border patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a nonwalled area we will not let them through big danger nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall
robert mueller and leakin lyin james comey are best friends just one of many mueller conflicts of interest and bye the way wasnt the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi who i do not know in charge of legal at the corrupt clinton foundation a total witch hunt
will robert muellers big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his republicans only report will andrew weissmans horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the report he wrongly destroyed peoples lives took down great companies only to be
overturned in the united states supreme court doing same thing to people now will all of the substantial many contributions made by the angry democrats to the campaign of crooked hillary be listed in top of report will the people that worked for the clinton
foundation be listed at the top of the report will the scathing document written about lyin james comey by the man in charge of the case rod rosenstein who also signed the fisa warrant be a big part of the report isnt rod therefore totally conflicted will all of
the lying and leaking by the people doing the report also bruce ohr and his lovely wife molly comey brennan clapper all of the many fired people of the fbi be listed in the report will the corruption within the dnc clinton campaign be exposedand so much more
china talks are going very well
it has been incorrectly reported that rudy giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the mueller report that is fake news already pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final witch hunt report
today we honor those who perished years ago at pearl harbor and we salute every veteran who served in world war ii over the years that followed that horrific attack god bless america 
we will be doing a major counter report to the mueller report this should never again be allowed to happen to a future president of the united states
i am pleased to announce that heather nauert spokeswoman for the united states department of state will be nominated to serve as united nations ambassador i want to congratulate heather and thank ambassador nikki haley for her great service to our country
i am pleased to announce that i will be nominating the honorable william p barr for the position of attorney general of the united states as the former ag for george hw bush
and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the country he will be a great addition to our team i look forward to having him join our very successful administration
mike pompeo is doing a great job i am very proud of him his predecessor rex tillerson didnt have the mental capacity needed he was dumb as a rock and i couldnt get rid of him fast enough he was lazy as hell now it is a whole new ballgame great spirit at state
hopefully mitch mcconnell will ask for a vote on criminal justice reform it is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support it will also help a lot of people save taxpayer dollars and keep our communities safe go for it mitch
it is being reported that leakin' james comey was told by department of justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous administration force him to answer the questions under oath
totally clears the president thank you
the paris agreement isnt working out so well for paris protests and riots all over france people do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries that are questionably run in order to maybe protect the environment chanting we want trump love france
the idea of a european military didnt work out too well in ww i or but the us was there for you and always will be all we ask is that you pay your fair share of nato germany is paying while the us pays of a much larger gdp to protect europe fairness
after two years and millions of pages of documents and a cost of over no collusion
i am pleased to announce my nomination of fourstar general mark milley chief of staff of the united states army as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff replacing general joe dunford who will be retiring
i am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our country date of transition to be determined
this is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here at this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no russian collusion there is nothing impeachable here time for the witch hunt to end
very sad day night in paris maybe its time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes the us was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year
watched da nang dick blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in vietnam which he never saw as the bullets whizzed by da nang dicks head as he was saving soldiers
left and right he then woke up from his dream screaming that he lied next time i go to vietnam i will ask the dick to travel with me
great honor to be headed to the armynavy game today will be there shortly landing now 
 twittercomyjhqrfh
it was my honor to attend todays in philadelphia a great game played all around by our heroes congratulations on the win 
on occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didnt know didnt recall or couldnt remember things when asked opened investigations on americans not didnt know who signed off and didnt know christopher steele all lies
leakin james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day his friday testimony was so untruthful this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president they are now exposed
the trump administration has accomplished more than any other us administration in its first two not even years of existence we are having a great time doing it all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mindtruly the enemy of the people
i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our agenda i will be making a decision soon
democrats cant find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comeys testimony no smocking gunno collusion thats because there was no collusion so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution
which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like obamas but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine lawyers liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced witch hunt
james comeys behind closed doors testimony reveals that there was not evidence of campaign collusion with russia when he left the fbi in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started
former fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier details on tuesday night
despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls fences or border patrol officers military they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries
ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border a great wall would be however a far easier less expensive solution we have already built large new sections fully renovated others making them like new the democrats
however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security they want open borders for anyone to come in this brings large scale crime and disease our southern border is now secure and will remain that way
i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer nancy pelosi in democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so today they no longer want border security they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker but the wall will get built
people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall they know how important it is
great job by michael anton on a true national security expert
very productive conversations going on with china watch for some important announcements
fake news has it purposely wrong many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position why wouldnt someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington please report news correctly thank you
james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in in other words he is and has been a democrat comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded
i dont care what you think of the presidentit cannot bleed over to the fbicomey is confirming there is bias in the fbi chris swecker
thanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season
another very bad terror attack in france we are going to strengthen our borders even more chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security
the democrats and president obama gave iran billion dollars and got nothing but they cant give billion dollars for national security and a wall
 melania will be interviewed by tonight on at pme
i often stated one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall this has never changed our new deal with mexico and canada the usmca is so much better than the old very costly antiusa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall
i never directed michael cohen to break the law he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law it is called advice of counsel and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made that is why they get paid despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly
stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not
guilty even on a civil basis those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he didincluding the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me
they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated the fbi said he didnt lie and they overrode the fbi they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements sad
witch hunt
if it was a conservative that said what crazed mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday using a certain horrible term that person would be banned permanently from television
she will probably be given a pass despite their terrible ratings congratulations to our great ambassador to germany for having the courage to take this horrible issue on
just did an interview with on airing now pme enjoy
happy nd birthday our entire nation is forever grateful for all you do we love you twittercomxlocxofvma
today it was my honor to welcome our nations newly elected governors to the 
lets not do a shutdown democrats do whats right for the american people 
china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them they have just suspended us tariff hikes us is doing very well china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal it could happen and rather soon
many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with north korea i always reply by saying we are in no hurry there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country
kim jong un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people we are doing just fine
thank you to for agreeing to expand operations in the us and thereby creating thousands of jobs 
i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney director of the office of management budget will be named acting white house chief of staff replacing general john kelly who has served our country with distinction mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration
i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again john will be staying until the end of the year he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service
for the record there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff mick m will do a great job
as i predicted all along obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects preexisting conditions mitch and nancy get it done
wow but not surprisingly obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas great news for america
secretary of the interior will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation
the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week
never in the history of our country has the press been more dishonest than it is today stories that should be good are bad stories that should be bad are horrible many stories like with the real story on russia clinton the dnc seldom get reported too bad
the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard run by failed prognosticator bill kristol who like many others never had a clue is flat broke and out of business too bad may it rest in peace
wow texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news witch hunt
a real scandal is the one sided coverage hour by hour of networks like nbc democrat spin machines like saturday night live it is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and dem commercials should be tested in courts cant be legal only defame belittle collusion
so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page his lover just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward want them
remember michael cohen only became a rat after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started they broke into an attorneys office why didnt they break into the dnc to get the server or crookeds office
at the request of many i will be reviewing the case of a us military hero major matt golsteyn who is charged with murder he could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas 
judge ken starr former solicitor generel independent counsel just stated that after two years there is no evidence or proof of collusion further that there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the president thank you judge 
the democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now remember the picture of children in cages the obama years however if you dont separate far more people will come smugglers use the kids
required television watching is last weeks interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the interview with a jerome corsi if that doesnt tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will very sad
it looks here as though general flynns defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like
a persecution of the president daniel henninger the wall street journal thank you people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place
the russian witch hunt hoax started as the insurance policy long before i even got elected is very bad for our country they are entrapping people for misstatements lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago nothing to do with collusion a democrat scam
the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable hurts families badly we have a chance working with the democrats to deliver great healthcare a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans
it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us paris is burning and china way down the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike take the victory
anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control
today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the nd round of market facilitation payments our economy is stronger than everwe stand with our farmers
biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover lisa page were purposely illegally deleted would have explained whole hoax which is now under protest
good luck today in court to general michael flynn will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about russian collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign there was no collusion
i hope the people over at the fed will read todays wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake also dont let the market become any more illiquid than it already is stop with the bs feel the market dont just go by meaningless numbers good luck
facebook twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join they have removed many names greatly slowed the level and speed of increase they have acknowledgeddone nothing
illegal immigration costs the united states more than billion dollars a year how was this allowed to happen
russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steeles claims when you get into the details of the steele dossier the specific allegations we have not seen the evidence to support them theres good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations
will never be proven and are likely false thank you to michael isikoff yahoo for honesty what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately also it was paid for by crooked hillary dnc
michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed
president donald j trumps commission on school safety examined ways to make our schools safe for all students and teachers read more 
congratulations to on her appointment by governor as the great new senator from arizona i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job
the democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall but we are not building a concrete wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it
it will be beautiful and at the same time give our country the security that our citizens deserve it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed
america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens even those who have made mistakes congratulations to the senate on the bipartisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill
this will keep our communities safer and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it in addition to everything else billions of dollars will be saved i look forward to signing this into law
in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to border security and the military the democrats fight to the death we won on the military which is being completely rebuilt one way or the other we will win on the wall
mexico is paying indirectly for the wall through the new usmca the replacement for nafta far more money coming to the us because of the tremendous dangers at the border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the united states military will build the wall
we have defeated isis in syria my only reason for being there during the trump presidency
the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money both mine and others to great charities over the years with me taking no fees rent salaries etc now as usual i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by
sleazebag ag eric schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation
in any event it goes on and on the new ag who is now being replaced by yet another ag who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda does little else but rant rave politic against me will never be treated fairly by these people a total double standard of justice
after historic victories against isis its time to bring our great young people home 
col jim carafano on trump has made the middle east a better place when trump came into office isis was running amuck in the middle east over a million refugees poured into western europe none of that is happening today thats all due to trump
trump gets no credit for what hes done in the middle east so true thank you laura
im proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in syria senator rand paul i couldnt agree more with the presidents decision by definition this is the opposite of an obama decision senator mike lee
getting out of syria was no surprise ive been campaigning on it for years and six months ago when i very publicly wanted to do it i agreed to stay longer russia iran syria others are the local enemy of isis we were doing there work time to come home rebuild 
does the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who in almost all cases do not appreciate what we are doing do we want to be there forever time for others to finally fight
russia iran syria many others are not happy about the us leaving despite what the fake news says because now they will have to fight isis and others who they hate without us i am building by far the most powerful military in the world isis hits us they are doomed
the democrats who know steel slats wall are necessary for border security are putting politics over country what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect border security usa wins
with so much talk about the wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol ice and our great military remember the caravans well they didnt get through and none are forming or on their way border is tight fake news silent
when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill i was promised the wall and border security by leadership would be done by end of year now it didnt happen we foolishly fight for border security for other countries but not for our beloved usa not good
congress just passed the criminal justice reform bill known as the congratulations this is a great bipartisan achievement for everybody when both parties work together we can keep our country safer a wonderful thing for the usa
so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives billions of why are we fighting for our enemy syria by staying killing isis for them russia iran other locals time to focus on our country bring our youth back home where they belong
farm bill signing in minutes twittercomktssxvin
democrats it is time to come together and put the safety of the american people before politics border security must become a priority 
general jim mattis will be retiring with distinction at the end of february after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years during jims tenure tremendous progress has been made especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting
equipment general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations a new secretary of defense will be named shortly i greatly thank jim for his service
thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall the final numbers were and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before so proud of you all now on to the senate
soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said last week live from the oval office that the republicans didnt have the votes for border security today the house republicans voted and won nancy does not have to apologize all i want is great border security
senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything he will need democrat votes but as shown in the house good things happen if enough dems dont vote it will be a democrat shutdown house republicans were great yesterday
the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall calling it old fashioned the fact is there is nothing elses that will work and that has been true for thousands of years its like the wheel there is nothing better i know tech better than anyone technology
on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall properly designed and built walls work and the democrats are lying when they say they dont in israel the wall is successful will not be any different on our southern border hundreds of billions saved
no matter what happens today in the senate republican house members should be very proud of themselves they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall not one democrat voted yes and we won big i am very proud of you
the democrats whose votes we need in the senate will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed if the dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time people dont want open borders and crime
house republican vote 
shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security
even president ronald reagan tried for years to build a border wall or fence and was unable to do so others also have tried we will get it done one way or the other
mitch use the nuclear option and get it done our country is counting on you
thank you for being willing to go with the socalled nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security have my total support
there has never been a president who has been tougher but fair on china or russia never just look at the facts the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture
general anthony tata author dark winter i think the president is making the exact right move in syria all the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on isis intelligence and gave rise to isis
the democrats now own the shutdown
ive done more damage to isis than all recent presidentsnot even close
today it was my great honor to sign the a monumental bipartisan win for the american people 
today it was my honor to sign into law hr the countering weapons of mass destruction act of the act redesignates the domestic nuclear detection office as the countering weapons of mass destruction office read more 
a design of our steel slat barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful 
some of the many bills that i am signing in the oval office right now cancelled my trip on air force one to florida while we wait to see if the democrats will help us to protect americas southern border 
wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery
our great country must have border security 
i am in the white house working hard news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security gangs drugs human trafficking more but it could be a long stay on syria we were originally
going to be there for three months and that was seven years ago we never left when i became president isis was going wild now isis is largely defeated and other local countries including turkey should be able to easily take care of whatever remains were coming home
will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security
the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall let work begin
i won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless costly foreign wars also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe we fight for the borders of other countries but we wont fight for the borders of our own
senate adjourns until december th
i will not be going to florida because of the shutdown staying in the white house 
brett mcgurk who i do not know was appointed by president obama in was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving grandstander the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event
if anybody but your favorite president donald j trump announced that after decimating isis in syria we were going to bring our troops back home happy healthy that person would be the most popular hero in america with me hit hard instead by the fake news media crazy
when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis i gave him a second chance some thought i shouldnt i thought i should interesting relationshipbut i also gave all of the resources that he never really had allies are very importantbut not when they take advantage of us
the only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works
i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy previously boeing he will be great
i just had a long and productive call with president of turkey we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria the slow highly coordinated pullout of us troops from the area after many years they are coming home we also discussed heavily expanded trade

we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is the mistake of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars it all began years ago
senator bob corker just stated that im so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and thats what i told the people of our state thats what id do serve for two terms but that is not true wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldnt endorse him
bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal which i ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement i said no and the game was over i love tennessee
thanks i am very proud of the president this is exactly what he promised and i think the people agree with him weve been at war too long and in too many placesspent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere hes differentthats why he got elected
it should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world this is what president trump recognized in iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and hes rightthe generals still dont get the mistake 
mitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the us senate for years and the last two have been by far the best most productive of his career tax regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships much more great
the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border we need border security and as everyone knows you cant have border security without a wall the drones technology are just bells and whistles safety for america
the president has been remarkable i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning
president of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syriaand he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right next door our troops are coming home
virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it desperately needed
to those few senators who think i dont like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do what i dont like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade
we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the us and our taxpayers on trade general mattis did not see this as a problem i do and it is being fixed
for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with billion dollars in cash sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal now terminated approved by little bob corker
america is respected again
the only problem our economy has is the fed they dont have a feel for the market they dont understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who cant score because he has no touch he cant putt
i never lashed out at the acting attorney general of the us a man for whom i have great respect this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media
the wall is different than the billion dollars in border security the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand the reporting has been inaccurate on the point the problem is without the wall much of the rest of dollars are wasted
saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states see isnt it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the us that is miles away thanks to saudi a
i am all alone poor me in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about crazy
christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea progress being made looking forward to my next summit with chairman kim 
i am in the oval office just gave out a mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas we are already building and renovating many miles of wall some complete democrats must end shutdown and finish funding billions of dollars lives will be saved
merry christmas
i hope everyone even the fake news media is having a great christmas our country is doing very well we are securing our borders making great new trade deals and bringing our troops back home we are finally putting america first merry christmas 
 melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq god bless the usa 
just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany one thing is certain we have incredible people representing our country people that know how to win
have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members criminals from coming into our country do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats
the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of great people wanting expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a us record
the reason the daca for wall deal didnt get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the th circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and thats where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall
border patrol agents want the wall democrats say they dont want the wall even though they know it is really needed and they dont want ice they dont have much to campaign on do they an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity
there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop time to get tough on border security build the wall
i totally agree 
brad blakeman the american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the president says look this is your neighborhood youve got to stand up to protect yourselves dont always look to america
this isnt about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly in israel the wall works this is only about the dems not letting donald trump the republicans have a win they may have the senate votes but we have the issue border security 
cnn others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign can you imagine my saying no we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported
we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with hard to believe there was a congress president who would approve
the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over billion dollars a year not including drug money which would be many times that amount that i would consider closing the southern border a profit making operation we build a wall or
close the southern border bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs go back to prenafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico either we build finish the wall or we close the border
honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it we will be cutting off all aid to these countries taking advantage of us for years
thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany great things are happening
the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax this is a total obstruction of justice all texts demanded
i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military
just had a long and very good call with president xi of china deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made
any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally they cant if we had a wall they wouldnt even try the two
children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadnt given her water in days border patrol needs the wall and it will all end they are working so hard getting so little credit
for those that naively ask why didnt the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need democrat votes and they will gives us none for border security now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad 
 is being called the year of the worker by steve moore coauthor of trumponomics it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the best job market in years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers big wage gains
absolutely nothing on russian collusion kimberley strassel the wall street journal the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats
it turns out to be true now that the department of justice and the fbi under president obama rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump and now it looks like in a corrupt illegal way the facts are out now whole hoax exposed 
veterans on president trumps handling of border security approval rating on being a strong leader ap poll thank you
great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans
president and mrs obama builthas a ten foot wall around their dc mansioncompound i agree totally necessary for their safety and security the us needs the same thing slightly larger version
an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me
if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero isis is mostly gone were slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants
i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me my tactics which are working just doing what i said i was going to do
except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be i campaigned against the never ending wars remember
i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall our southern border has long been an open wound where drugs criminals including human traffickers and illegals would pour into our country dems should get back here an fix now
i am the only person in america who could say that im bringing our great troops back home with victory and get bad press it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy
im in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in and one more yes but with me in office ill get it built and fast
its incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesnt work it does and properly built almost they say its old technology but so is the wheel they now say it is immoral but it is far more immoral for people to be dying
heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from
senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country very unfair
happy new year 
mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the usa is saving through the new trade deal the usmca that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal which has so badly hurt our country mexico canada will also thrive good for all
the democrats will probably submit a bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security namely the wall you see without the wall there can be no border security the tech stuff is just by comparison meaningless bells whistles
remember this throughout the ages some things never get better and never change you have walls and you have wheels it was always that way and it will always be that way please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall
dr sebastian gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out why we fight lots of insight enjoy
happy new year to everyone including the haters and the fake news media will be a fantastic year for those not suffering from trump derangement syndrome just calm down and enjoy the ride great things are happening for our country
happy new year
the democrats much as i suspected have allocated no money for a new wall so imaginative the problem is without a wall there can be no real border security and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border
general mcchrystal got fired like a dog by obama last assignment a total bust known for big dumb mouth hillary lover 
one thing has now been proven the democrats do not care about open borders and all of the crime and drugs that open borders bring
congratulations to president who just made a great inauguration speech the usa is with you

kim jong un says north korea will not make or test nuclear weapons or give them to others he is ready to meet president trump anytime pbs news hour i also look forward to meeting with chairman kim who realizes so well that north korea possesses great economic potential
do you think its just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut
for far too long senate democrats have been obstructing more than nominations these great americans left their jobs to serve our country but cant because dems are blocking them some for two yearshistoric record passed committees but schumer putting them on hold bad
here we go with mitt romney but so fast question will be is he a flake i hope not would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful i won big and he didnt he should be happy for all republicans be a team player win
mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built we have done a lot of work billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security quick payback
important meeting today on border security with republican and democrat leaders in congress both parties must work together to pass a funding bill that protects this nation and its people this is the first and most important duty of government
i remain ready and willing to work with democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders supports the agents and officers on the ground and keeps america safe lets get it done
sadly there can be no real border security without the wall
maga list historic results help trump make case for reelection 
the shutdown is only because of the presidential election the democrats know they cant win based on all of the achievements of trump so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security and presidential harassment for them strictly politics
the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on at some point this had to be done
the rnc has a great chairwoman in ronna mcdaniel and the has never been stronger we achieved historic wins with her help last year 
michael pillsbury interviewed by they have the motive of making the president look bad instead of president trump being portrayed as a hero the first president to take china on its years overdue
president trump deserves a lot of credit but again you have the antitrump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit
as i have stated many times if the democrats take over the house or senate there will be disruption to the financial markets we won the senate they won the house things will settle down they only want to impeach me because they know they cant win in too much success
how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done nothing wrong no collusion with russia it was the dems that colluded had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular republican in party history 
great jobs numbers just announced

thank you to kanye west for your nice words criminal justice reform is now law passed in a very bipartisan way
great support coming from all sides for border security including wall on our very dangerous southern border teams negotiating this weekend washington post and nbc reporting of events including fake sources has been very inaccurate to put it mildly
the democrats could solve the shutdown problem in a very short period of time all they have to do is approve real border security including a wall something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly this would be so easy to do
many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation
i dont care that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats i want to stop the shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on strong border security i am in the white house ready to go where are the dems
we are working hard at the border but we need a wall in million pounds of narcotics seized adults arrested with criminal records and gang members including ms apprehended a big human trafficking problem
the democrats want billions of dollars for foreign aid but they dont want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our border figure that one out
great tweet today by tyler q houlton on the being put out by a proud member of the opposition party is doing a great job

we simply cannot allow people to pour into the united states undetected undocumented unchecked barrack obama i voted when i was a senator to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in hillary clinton 
the only reason they do not want to build a wall is that walls work of our illegal border crossings will end crime in our country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year a properly planned and constructed wall will pay for itself many times a year

vp mike pence and group had a productive meeting with the schumerpelosi representatives today many details of border security were discussed we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete it is both stronger less obtrusive good solution and made in the usa
with all of the success that our country is having including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts the fake news totally dishonest media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the truth
the fake news will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the trump administration and me look as bad as possible they use nonexistent sources write stories that are total fiction our country is doing so well yet this is a sad day in america
the fake news media in our country is the real opposition party it is truly the enemy of the people we must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting
congressman adam smith the new chairman of the house armed services committee just stated yes there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency its been done a number of times no doubt but lets get our deal done in congress
the failing new york times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on syria no different from my original statements we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary
i am pleased to inform you that i will address the nation on the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border tuesday night at pm eastern
endless wars especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing will eventually come to a glorious end
economic numbers looking really good can you imagine if i had long term zero interest rates to play with like the past administration rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today that would have been so easy still markets up big since election

just left a meeting with chuck and nancy a total waste of time i asked what is going to happen in days if i quickly open things up are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier nancy said no i said byebye nothing else works
the mainstream media has never been more dishonest than it is now nbc and msnbc are going crazy they report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts they are truly the opposition party working with the dems may even be worse than fake news cnn if that is possible
gave an off the record luncheon somewhat of a white house tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers
cryin chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that i slammed the table walked out of the room he had a temper tantrum because i knew he would say that and after nancy said no to proper border security i politely said byebye and left no slamming
there is great unity with the republicans in the house and senate despite the fake news media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise the opposition party the dems know we must have strong border security but dont want to give trump another one of many wins
great support for border security and the wall even greater than anyone would know presidents supporters do not want him to cave i wont

wow just learned in the failing new york times that the corrupt former leaders of the fbi almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason with no proof after i fired lyin james comey a total sleaze
funny thing about james comey everybody wanted him fired republican and democrat alike after the rigged botched crooked hillary investigation where she was interviewed on july th weekend not recorded or sworn in and where she said she didnt know anything a lie
the fbi was in complete turmoil see ny post because of comeys poor leadership and the way he handled the clinton mess not to mention his usurpation of powers from the justice department my firing of james comey was a great day for america he was a crooked cop
who is being totally protected by his best friend bob mueller the angry democrats leaking machines who have no interest in going after the real collusion and much more by crooked hillary clinton her campaign and the democratic national committee just watch
i have been far tougher on russia than obama bush or clinton maybe tougher than any other president at the same time as i have often said getting along with russia is a good thing not a bad thing i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again
lyin james comey andrew mccabe peter s and his lover agent lisa page more all disgraced andor fired and caught in the act these are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your president part of the witch hunt remember the insurance policy this is it

democrats are saying that daca is not worth it and dont want to include in talks many hispanics will be coming over to the republican side watch

im in the white house waiting the democrats are everywhere but washington as people await their pay they are having fun and not even talking
the damage done to our country from a badly broken border drugs crime and so much that is bad is far greater than a shutdown which the dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to washington

when i became president isis was out of control in syria running rampant since then tremendous progress made especially over last weeks caliphate will soon be destroyed unthinkable two years ago negotiating are proceeding well in afghanistan after years of fighting
fighting continues but the people of afghanistan want peace in this never ending war we will soon see if talks will be successful north korea relationship is best it has ever been with us no testing getting remains hostages returned decent chance of denuclearization
time will tell what will happen with north korea but at the end of the previous administration relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen now a whole different story i look forward to seeing kim jong un shortly progress being madebig difference
if the committee of republicans and democrats now meeting on border security is not discussing or contemplating a wall or physical barrier they are wasting their time
three separate caravans marching to our border the numbers are tremendous 
the intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of iran they are wrong when i became president iran was making trouble all over the middle east and beyond since ending the terrible iran nuclear deal they are much different but
a source of potential danger and conflict they are testing rockets last week and more and are coming very close to the edge there economy is now crashing which is the only thing holding them back be careful of iran perhaps intelligence should go back to school

democrats are becoming the party of late term abortion high taxes open borders and crime
more troops being sent to the southern border to stop the attempted invasion of illegals through large caravans into our country we have stopped the previous caravans and we will stop these also with a wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive being built
looking for china to open their markets not only to financial services which they are now doing but also to our manufacturing farmers and other us businesses and industries without this a deal would be unacceptable
schumer and the democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with iran they have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our country iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and iran deal termination dems put us in a bad place but now good
very sadly murder cases in mexico in rose from to this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country worse even than afghanistan much caused by drugs wall is being built
just concluded a great meeting with my intel team in the oval office who told me that what they said on tuesday at the senate hearing was mischaracterized by the media and we are very much in agreement on iran isis north korea etc their testimony was distorted press

highly respected senator richard burr chairman of senate intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of russia collusion we dont have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia thank you
not only did senator burrs committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia its important because they interviewed witnesses and pages of documents the committee has direct access to intelligence information thats classified 
now we find out that adam schiff was spending time together in aspen with glenn simpson of gps fusion who wrote the fake and discredited dossier even though simpson was testifying before schiff john solomon of 
the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump russia
it is all a giant and illegal hoax developed long before the election itself but used as an excuse by the democrats as to why crooked hillary clinton lost the election someday the fake news media will turn honest report that donald j trump was actually a great candidate
working hard thank you 
deepest sympathies to congresswoman debbie dingell and the entire family of john dingell longest serving congressman in countrys history which if people understand politics means he was very smart a great reputation and highly respected man

the democrats in congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see when the republicans had the majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn the dems are trying to win an election in that they know they cannot legitimately win
we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the election the us would be in a depression right now we were heading down and dont let the democrats sound bites fool you
the democrats just dont seem to want border security they are fighting border agents recommendations if you believe news reports they are not offering much for the wall they look to be making this a campaign issue the wall will get built one way or the other
today elizabeth warren sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas joined the race for president will she run as our first native american presidential candidate or has she decided that after years this is not playing so well anymore see you on the campaign trail liz
i think it is very important for the democrats to press forward with their green new deal it would be great for the socalled carbon footprint to permanently eliminate all planes cars cows oil gas the military even if no other country would do the same brilliant
senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this
african americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in virginia
gallup poll open borders will potentially attract million latin americans this would be a disaster for the us we need the wall now
i dont think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal they are offering very little money for the desperately needed border wall now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention
it was a very bad week for the democrats with the great economic numbers the virginia disaster and the state of the union address now with the terrible offers being made by them to the border committee i actually believe they want a shutdown they want a new subject
the media was able to get my work schedule something very easy to do but it should have been reported as a positive not negative when the term executive time is used i am generally working not relaxing in fact i probably work more hours than almost any past president
the fact is when i took over as president our country was a mess depleted military endless wars a potential war with north korea va high taxes too many regulations border immigration healthcare problems much more i had no choice but to work very long hours
president is on sound legal ground to declare a national emergency there have been national emergencies declared since the law was enacted in and right now that are currently active so this is hardly unprecedented congressman 
the border committee democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed wall they overrode recommendations of border patrol experts but they dont even want to take muderers into custody whats going on
well it happened again amy klobuchar announced that she is running for president talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow ice and freezing temperatures bad timing by the end of her speech she looked like a snowmanwoman

just arrived in vietnam thank you to all of the people for the great reception in hanoi tremendous crowds and so much love
vietnam is thriving like few places on earth north korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize the potential is awesome a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend kim jong un we will know fairly soon very interesting
the democrats should stop talking about what i should do with north korea and ask themselves instead why they didnt do it during eight years of the obama administration
i have now spent more time in vietnam than da nang dick blumenthal the third rate senator from connecticut how is connecticut doing his war stories of his heroism in vietnam were a total fraud he was never even there we talked about it today with vietnamese leaders

wow just revealed that michael cohen wrote a love letter to trump manuscript for a new book that he was pushing written and submitted long after charlottesville and helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie
congress must demand the transcript of michael cohens new book given to publishers a short time ago your heads will spin when you see the lies misrepresentations and contradictions against his thursday testimony like a different person he is totally discredited
oh i see now that the year russian collusion case has fallen apart there was no collusion except bye crooked hillary and the democrats they say gee i have an idea lets look at trumps finances and every deal he has ever done lets follow discredited michael cohen
and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on wednesday no way its time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought witch hunt time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed republicans have been abused long enough must end now
michael cohens book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before he must have forgotten about his book when he testified what does hillary clintons lawyer lanny davis say about this one is he being paid by crooked hillary using her lawyer
i never like being misinterpreted but especially when it comes to otto warmbier and his great family remember i got otto out along with three others the previous administration did nothing and he was taken on their watch of course i hold north korea responsible
for ottos mistreatment and death most important otto warmbier will not have died in vain otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength which will last for many years into the future i love otto and think of him often
i have asked china to immediately remove all tariffs on our agricultural products including beef pork etc based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with trade discussions

will be speaking at cpac at this morning record crowd live broadcast enjoy
 it was a day train ride to vietnam not hours
thank you 
virtually everything failed lawyer michael cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me its a total new love letter to trump and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction
the brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer michael cohen shows his testimony was a total lie pundits should only use it
weve got nasa rocking again great activity and success congrats to spacex and all
said was a total lie but fake media wont show it i am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted corrupt people in a witch hunt that is illegal should never have been allowed to start and only because i won the election despite this great success
after more than two years of presidential harassment the only things that have been proven is that democrats and other broke the law the hostile cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no collusion his just written book manuscript showed what he
look how theyre acting now and how we act when were in the majority what the democrats are doing is an abuse of power they couldnt find anythingthey took a fake dossier couldnt find any collusion now they have a fake witness in cohen congressman mark green rtn
my wonderful daughter ivanka will be interviewed tonight by steve hilton on the next revolution pm she works so hard and has achieved so much for the usaand gets so little credit then watch mark levin at pm a great show
the reason i do not want military drills with south korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the us for which we are not reimbursed that was my position long before i became president also reducing tensions with north korea at this time is a good thing
presidential harassment by crazed democrats at the highest level in the history of our country likewise the most vicious and corrupt mainstream media that any president has ever had to endure yet the most successful first two years for any
president we are winning big the envy of the world but just think what it could be
for the democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar fraudster at the same time as the very important nuclear summit with north korea is perhaps a new low in american politics and may have contributed to the walk never done when a president is overseas shame
schumer the democrats are hurting our country senate republicans must take bold action 
and also illegally leaking to fake news cnn others 
to the great people of alabama and surrounding areas please be careful and safe tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming to the families and friends of the victims and to the injured god bless you all
fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the tornadoes one of the best in our country has been so informed she is working closely with fema and me
the military drills or war games as i call them were never even discussed in my mtg w kim jong un of nkfake news i made that decision long ago because it costs the us far too much money to have those games especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost
now that the dems are going to try switch from collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didnt accept the will of the people in the last election they will do anything to get rid of the president it will never work
there is no collusion all of these investigations are in search of a crime democrats have no evidence to impeach president trump ridiculous 
presidential harassment 
the american media has changed forever news organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition like the new yorker or theyve been purchased by jeff bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for
 amazon like the washington post its hard to remember that not so long ago america had prestige media outlets but not anymore the fake news media is the true enemy of the people
we the people will now be subjected to the biggest display of modern day mccarthyismwhich is the widest fishing net expeditionevery aspect of the presidents lifeall in order to get power back so they can institute socialism

scott gottlieb who has done an absolutely terrific job as commissioner of the fda plans to leave government service sometime next month
scott has helped us to lower drug prices get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market and so many other things he and his talents will be greatly missed
crooked hillary clinton confirms she will not run in rules out a third bid for white house awshucks does that mean i wont get to run against her again she will be sorely missed
hans von spakovsky i havent seen any evidence of actual violations of the law which is usually a basis before you start an investigation adam schiff seems to be copying joseph mccarthy in wanting to open up investigations when they dont have any evidence of wrongdoing
weirdo tom steyer doesnt have the guts or money to run for president hes all talk 
senate republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent they are voting on desperately needed border security the wall our country is being invaded with drugs human traffickers criminals of all shapes and sizes thats what this vote is all about stay united

american workforce policy advisory board meeting at the 
congressman chris stewart no one is accusing the president of a crime and yet they the democrats are issuing hundreds of subpoenas this is unprecedented they are desperately trying to find anything they can even a punctuation mistake in a document
wall street journal more migrant families crossing into the us illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year we are doing a great job at the border but this is a national emergency
democrats just blocked from holding a debate good then i think ill do the same thing with the fake news networks and the radical left democrats in the general election debates
it was not a campaign contribution and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me fake news
we are on track to apprehend more than one million people coming across the southern border this year great job by border patrol and others who are working in a broken system can be fixed by congress so easily and quickly if only the democrats would get on board

border patrol and law enforcement has apprehended captured large numbers of illegal immigrants at the border they wont be coming into the us the wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future and now
i hope the grandstanding governor of california is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the socalled fast train which is billions over budget in total disarray time to reduce taxes in california
wacky nut job who still hasnt figured out that despite all odds and an entire democrat party of far left radicals against me not to mention certain republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight i am winning on the border major sections of wall are being built
and renovated with much more to follow shortly tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended captured at the border and not allowed into our country with another president millions would be pouring in i am stopping an invasion as the wall gets built 
the witch hunt continues 
this is just the beginning 
will soon be judges 
donald trumps approval rating is at or near his highest level ever the media is not being honest about what is happening in this country jesse watters
despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of american politics the trump administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other administration judges biggest tax regulation cuts va choice best economy lowest unemployment much more
more people are working today in the united states than at any time in our countrys history that is a big deal
theres not one shred of evidence that president trump has done anything wrong one america news so true a total witch hunt all started illegally by crooked hillary clinton the dnc and others
at a recent round table meeting of business executives long after formally introducing tim cook of apple i quickly referred to tim apple as timapple as an easy way to save time words the fake news was disparagingly all over this it became yet another bad trump story
making daylight saving time permanent is ok with me
republican senators have a very easy vote this week it is about border security and the wall stopping crime drugs etc not constitutionality and precedent it is an positive issue the dems are united as usual on a issue open borders and crime get tough rs
jewish people are leaving the democratic party we saw a lot of anti israel policies start under the obama administration and it got worsts worse there is antisemitism in the democratic party they dont care about israel or the jewish people elizabeth pipko jexodus
patrick moore cofounder of greenpeace the whole climate crisis is not only fake news its fake science there is no climate crisis theres weather and climate all around the world and in fact carbon dioxide is the main building block of all life wow
airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly pilots are no longer needed but rather computer scientists from mit i see it all the time in many products always seeking to go one unnecessary step further when often old and simpler is far better split second decisions are
needed and the complexity creates danger all of this for great cost yet very little gain i dont know about you but i dont want albert einstein to be my pilot i want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane
new york state and its governor andrew cuomo are now proud members of the group of presidential harassers no wonder people are fleeing the state in record numbers the witch hunt continues
all part of the witch hunt hoax started by little eric schneiderman cuomo so many leaving new york 
so many records being set with respect to our economy unemployment numbers among best ever a beautiful thing to watch
i greatly appreciate nancy pelosis statement against impeachment but everyone must remember the minor fact that i never did anything wrong the economy and unemployment are the best ever military and vets are great and many other successes how do you impeach
a man who is considered by many to be the president with the most successful first two years in history especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors
jay leno points out that comedy on the very boring late night shows is totally onesided its tough when theres only one topic actually the onesided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me unwatchable but remember we are number one president

the just revealed fbi agent lisa page transcripts make the obama justice department look exactly like it was a broken and corrupt machine hopefully justice will finally be served much more to come
the fake news photoshopped pictures of melania then propelled conspiracy theories that its actually not her by my side in alabama and other places they are only getting more deranged with time
comey testified under oath that it was a unanimous decision on crooked hillary lisa page transcripts show he lied 
democrats will have a unanimous vote on a issue in opposing republican senators tomorrow the dems are for open borders and crime
republican senators are overthinking tomorrows vote on national emergency it is very simply border securityno crime should not be thought of any other way we have a major national emergency at our border and the people of our country know it very well
double standard former fbi lawyer lisa page admits being told to go easy on clinton very unfair 
the lisa page fbi transcript also confirms earlier reporting that page testified russian collusion was still unproven when special counsel robert mueller was appointed catherine herridge in other words they appointed someone when there was and is no crime bad
i agree with rand paul this is a total disgrace and should never happen to another president 
democrats are frantic to throw something else at the president thats why you saw those subpoenas its ridiculous just because your still upset over an election that happened years ago you should not be allowed to ruin peoples lives like this lara trump 
a big national emergency vote today by the united states senate on border security the wall which is already under major construction i am prepared to veto if necessary the southern border is a national security and humanitarian nightmare but it can be easily fixed
my administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale trade deal with the united kingdom the potential is unlimited
the democrats are border deniers they refuse to see or acknowledge the death crime drugs and human trafficking at our southern border
the three very weak and untalented late night hosts are fighting over table scraps carson did a great job it wasnt political i dont know what theyre going to do in when hes no longer president will be wacky in the unemployment line michael loftus 
happy national ag day 
prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the national emergency at the southern border and to protect the american people are both constitutional and expressly authorized by congress
if at a later date congress wants to update the law i will support those efforts but todays issue is border security and crime dont vote with pelosi
a vote for todays resolution by republican senators is a vote for nancy pelosi crime and the open border democrats
congratulations big news for us auto workers the usmca is already fixing the broken nafta deal 
veto
i look forward to vetoing the just passed democrat inspired resolution which would open borders while increasing crime drugs and trafficking in our country i thank all of the strong republicans who voted to support border security and our desperately needed wall
my warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of new zealand after the horrible massacre in the mosques innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured the us stands by new zealand for anything we can do god bless all
the jexodus movement encourages jewish people to leave the democrat party total disrespect republicans are waiting with open arms remember jerusalem us embassy and the horrible iran nuclear deal 
new evidence that the obama era team of the fbi doj cia were working together to spy on and take out president trump all the way back in a transcript of peter strzoks testimony is devastating hopefully the mueller report will be covering this 
so if there was knowingly acknowledged to be zero crime when the special counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and now disgraced andrew mccabe he all stated no crime then the special counsel
should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report this was an illegal conflicted investigation in search of a crime russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win
this should never happen to a president again
id like to thank all of the great republican senators who bravely voted for strong border security and the wall this will help stop crime human trafficking and drugs entering our country watch when you get back to your state they will love you more than ever before

campaigning for the popular vote is much easier different than campaigning for the electoral college its like training for the yard dash vs a marathon the brilliance of the electoral college is that you must go to many states to win with the popular vote you go to
just the large states the cities would end up running the country smaller states the entire midwest would end up losing all power we cant let that happen i used to like the idea of the popular vote but now realize the electoral college is far better for the usa
not a good situation 
the democrats are getting very strange they now want to change the voting age to abolish the electoral college and increase significantly the number of supreme court justices actually youve got to win it at the ballot box

the mainstream media is under fire and being scorned all over the world as being corrupt and fake for two years they pushed the russian collusion delusion when they always knew there was no collusion they truly are the enemy of the people and the real opposition party
what were seeing on capitol hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the president should never have been started a disgrace
the republican party will become the party of healthcare

on this vietnam war veterans day we celebrate the brave vietnam veterans and all of americas veterans thank you for your service to our great nation
this has been an incredible couple of weeks for america 
the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world mexico has the strongest they make more than billion a year on the us therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now mexico must stop illegals from entering the us
through their country and our southern border mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the us far greater than border costs if mexico doesnt immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing
the border or large sections of the border next week this would be so easy for mexico to do but they just take our money and talk besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc that the border closing would be a good thing
had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the gdp stock market would have both been much higher world markets would be in a better place
robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous to even say after more than two years since the insurance policy statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth
the problem is no matter what the radical left democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough just watch they will harass complain resist the theme of their movement so maybe we should just take our victory and say no weve got a country to run
so funny that the new york times the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage negative and fake of collusion with russia and there was no collusion so they were either duped or corrupt in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee
a huge thanks to for serving america at the great work im proud to have you join the fulbright board 
in honor of his past service to our country navy seal will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court process should move quickly 
it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved but the dems dont care about the crime they dont want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa
mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa our detention areas are maxed out we will take no more illegals next step is to close the border this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico
the trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the us or our allies thats the definition of a foreignpolicy achievement bret stephens we are getting stronger all over the world watch
everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began we need to know for future generations to understand this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again
outrageous its the adam schiff problem people abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didnt prove to be true you look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival who made it james freeman 
the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long
now that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and others have gone back to the prewitch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists
democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly we have a major national emergency at our border get it done now
can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question report would be meaningless and a waste of the billions ridiculous that it costs to put together
the cost of obamacare is far too high for our great citizens the deductibles in many cases way over make it almost worthless or unusable good things are going to happen 
no matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough behind closed doors the dems are laughing
democrats should stop fighting sen david perdues disaster relief bill they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america
everybody agrees that obamacare doesnt work premiums deductibles are far too high really bad healthcare even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance the republicans
are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums cost deductibles than obamacare in other words it will be far less expensive much more usable than obamacare vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate win
back the house it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america also republicans will always support preexisting conditions the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare meantime the usa is doing better than ever is respected again
the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any place in history the people of puerto rico
are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas florida combined yet their government cant do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like
the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job of bringing the island back to health billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful
puerto rico got billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before all their local politicians do is complain ask for more money the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly only take from usa
the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j trump so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation
in repjerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton no information whatsoever would or could be legally released but with the no collusion mueller report which the dems hate he wants it all nothing will ever satisfy them 
world autism awareness day significance history and theme via 
robert mueller was a godlike figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited mueller report now the dems dont even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again it wont happen
there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country
after many years decades mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador they have all been taking us money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress
i havent seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us they have an open invitation we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity we are at an emergency crisis art del cueto national border patrol council
today we celebrate the tremendous accomplishments of americans with asd and reaffirm our commitment to work together to ensure that every member of our society is afforded equal opportunities to reach their full potential 
today it was my great honor to welcome secretary general to the 
i was never planning a vote prior to the election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me the republican party it will be on full display during the election as a much better less expensive alternative to obamacare
this will be a great campaign issue i never asked mitch mcconnell for a vote before the election as has been incorrectly reported as usual in the but only after the election when we take back the house etc republicans will always support preexisting conditions
congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border if no action border or large sections of border will close this is a national emergency
the first step act proves that our country can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we put politics aside and put the interests of all americans first 
the republican party is the party of the american dream
despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high
according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started so illegal
there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country
the new york times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the mueller report in fact they probably had no sources at all they are a fake news paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me
welcome back joe 
thank you 
democrats need to help fix the border crisis or get out of trumps way 
conservative support for trump wall soars to percent 
 how bad does border have to be for democrats to admit it's an emergency 
i am pleased to announce that jovita carranza will be nominated as the new administrator she will be replacing linda mcmahon who has done an outstanding job jovita was a great treasurer of the united states and i look forward to her joining my cabinet
trolling the mueller report democrats lost on collusion now theyre inventing a coverup james freeman 
the crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong mexico for the first time in decades is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border before the long march up to the us this is great and the way it should be the big flow will stop
however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the us will be forced to tariff at all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us if that doesnt work which it will i will close the border
this will supersede usmca likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border over americans die each year sooo many families destroyed

congratulations david a very big deal 
thank you and 
the lowest average jobs number for any president since economy doing great if the democrats win it is all over i agree
collusion was a hoax from day one 
thank you to two great people 
i have not read the mueller report yet even though i have every right to do so only know the conclusions and on the big one no collusion likewise recommendations made to our great ag who found no obstruction angry trump hating dems later brought to given two
years and million and they found no collusion no obstruction but the democrats no matter what we give them will never be satisfied a total waste of time as has just stated enough america has had enough what have you accomplished public is fed up
will be speaking today at the republican jewish coalition meeting in las vegas nevada see everyone soon 
so lets get this straight there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back
 against something i knew never existed collusion with russia so ridiculous no obstruction this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start
to every member of the thank you for your incredible support and your outstanding commitment to our country to our safety and to electing more republicans over the next months i know that the will help lead our party to another historic victory twittercompbrsppxf
why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt its about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts how and why did this terrible event begin never forget
give up trumphaters 
we have redeployed agents at the southern borders specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states this will cause traffic commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use
its powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the us and removing them back to their country of origin until mexico cleans up this ridiculous massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry
in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans we need their votes to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws once that happens all will be smooth we can never allow open borders
looks like bob muellers team of trump haters angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources sources no longer matter to our corrupt dishonest mainstream media they are a joke
pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released god bless them and their families
secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position and i would like to thank her for her service
i am pleased to announce that kevin mcaleenan the current us customs and border protection commissioner will become acting secretary for i have confidence that kevin will do a great job
more apprehensions captures at the southern border than in many years border patrol amazing country is full system has been broken for many years democrats in congress must agree to fix loopholes no open borders crimes drugs will close southern border if necessary
mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the united states or we will have no other choice than to close the border andor institute tariffs our country is full
the reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion and none of it happened charles hurt the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people
jerry nadler is not entitled to this information he is doing this to get it to the democrat nominee 
uganda must find the kidnappers of the american tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there bring them to justice openly and quickly
the democrats will never be satisfied no matter what they get how much they get or how many pages they get it will never end but thats the way life goes
congratulations to the baylor lady bears on their amazing win last night against notre dame to become the ncaa womens basketball national champions

i got along very well with jerry during the zoning and building process then i changed course slightly became president and now i am dealing with congressman nadler again some things never end but hopefully it will all go well for everyone only time will tell

everybody is now acknowledging that right from the time i announced my run for president i was correct on the border remember the heat i took democrats should now get rid of the loopholes the border is being fixed mexico will not let people through

biggest scandal of our time the coup that failed twittercomjuifnkt
beautiful afternoon in the oval office today with a few great american heroes 
house democrats want to negotiate a trillion spending increase but cant even pass their own plan we cant afford it anyway and its not happening
and the radical dems reeling in disarray as the president continues to win win and win again the left is pretending to be shocked by ag william barrs testimony before congress in which he said spying did occur on the trump campaign 
jobless claims at year low
i dont need to know any more were done absolutely done he mueller tried the case theres no collusion no matter what we do or give to the radical left it will never be enough
president obamas top white house lawyer gregory b craig was indicted yesterday on very serious charges this is a really big story but the fake news new york times didnt even put it on page one rather page not much better tiny page one corrupt news
democrats dont like the results of the mueller report so now theyre trying everything else they should stop wasting time and money and get back to real legislating especially on the border
even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency hopefully we will not be getting any more bad outrageous court decisions
due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only
the radical left always seems to have an open borders open arms policy so this should make them very happy
we will never forget 
wsj's strassel barr 'right' to say 'spying' occurred on trump campaign breitbart via 
if the radical left democrats all of a sudden dont want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities no more open arms why should others be expected to take them into their communities go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit
thank you jeh so well stated 
a fake story by politico made up sources thank you mount vernon 
another fake story on that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities of course this is not true mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day
in new york state democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants no wonder so many people are leaving ny very sad
i agree with kim jong un of north korea that our personal relationship remains very good perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate and that a third summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand north korea has tremendous potential for
extraordinary growth economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim i look forward to the day which could be soon when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world
why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the two years in the making no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops attorney general barr will make the decision
great playing by at the tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports many fantastic players in the hunt ratings gold good luck to all
the new york times sanctuary citiesimmigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact they never call to check for truth their sources often dont even exist a fraud they will lie cheat anyway possible to make me look bad in years they will be gone
when i won the election in the had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the election and me so badly they didnt have a clue it was pathetic they even apologized to me but now they are even worse really corrupt reporting
i never offered pardons to homeland security officials never ordered anyone to close our southern border although i have the absolute right to do so and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border and am not frustrated it is all fake corrupt news
so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently detained immigrants after release due to the ridiculous court ordered day rule if they dont want to serve our nation by taking care of them why should other cities towns
democrats must change the immigration laws fast if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds change the laws now
just out the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management high taxes
if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up to additional points and gdp would have been well over instead of with almost no inflation quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite
great masters going on right now is leading with holes left to play very exciting tune in

the radical left democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them they will always resist and obstruct
i finally agree with 
mark morgan president obamas border patrol chief gave the following message to me president trump stay the course i agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years
those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held congress must fix the laws and loopholes will be subject to homeland security given to sanctuary cities and states
the mueller report which was written by angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters and clinton supporters should have focused on the people who spied on my campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax that is never forget the crime
since there was no collusion why was there an investigation in the first place answer dirty cops dems and crooked hillary

bernie sanders and wife should pay the pretrump taxes on their almost in income he is always complaining about these big tax cuts except when it benefits him they made a fortune off of trump but so did everyone else and thats a good thing not a bad thing
i believe it will be crazy bernie sanders vs sleepy joe biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best economy in the history of our country and many other great things i look forward to facing whoever it may be may god rest their soul
on trumps icc win dems and republicans see eye to eye realclearpolitics 
wow fbi made payments to fake dossiers discredited author trump hater christopher steele the witch hunt has been a total fraud on your president and the american people it was brought to you by dirty cops crooked hillary and the dnc
democrats in congress must return from their vacations and change the immigration laws or the border despite the great job being done by border patrol will only get worse big sections of wall now being built
just had a wonderful conversation with francis offering condolences from the people of the united states for the horrible and destructive fire at notre dame cathedral i offered the help of our great experts on renovation and construction as i did

nolte poll shows media failed to gaslight public about trump campaign spying via 
the greatest political hoax of all time crimes were committed by crooked dirty cops and dncthe democrats
presidential harassment
attorney general william barrs press conference today at am et watch on 
no collusion no obstruction 
as i have been saying all along no collusion no obstruction 
today i was thrilled to host the soldier ride once again at the we were all deeply honored to be in the presence of true american heroes 
donald trump was being framed he fought back that is not obstruction i had the right to end the whole witch hunt if i wanted i could have fired everyone including mueller if i wanted i chose not to i had the right to use executive privilege i didnt
anything the russians did concerning the election was done while obama was president he was told about it and did nothing most importantly the vote was not affected
when there is not an underlying crime with regard to collusion in fact the whole thing was a made up fraud it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something there was no underlying crime 
if dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime and found they couldnt it would mean there wasnt any evidence you did it and thats what happened here thats what we just learned from the mueller report 
the mueller report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the white house press in the history of this country they know they liedmany reporters lied about russia collusion and so much more clapper brennan all lies 
kimberley strassel should get the pulitzer she is a treasure and i dont know her who correctly called the russia hoax right from the start others who were soooo wrong will get the prize fake news 
statements are made about me by certain people in the crazy mueller report in itself written by angry democrat trump haters which are fabricated totally untrue watch out for people that take socalled notes when the notes never existed until needed because i never
agreed to testify it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the report about me some of which are total bullshit only given to make the other person look good or me to look bad this was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened a
big fat waste of time energy and money to be exact it is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even spying or treason this should never happen again
the washington post and new york times are in my opinion two of the most dishonest media outlets around truly the enemy of the people 
time for democrats to accept reality 
trump has been totally vindicated 
wishing a happy passover to all those celebrating in america israel and around the world 
despite the fact that the mueller report should not have been authorized in the first place was written as nastily as possible by angry democrats who were true trump haters including highly conflicted bob mueller himself the end result is no collusion no obstruction
the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia the russia hoax is dead
the end result of the greatest witch hunt in us political history is no collusion with russia and no obstruction pretty amazing
if spent the same energy fighting barack obama as he does fighting donald trump he could have won the race maybe 
check out life liberty levin on now pm
good night of television pm pm with interview of followed by greg g honest commentary is always nice
thank you and 
happy easter i have never been happier or more content because your country is doing so well with an economy that is the talk of the world and may be stronger than it has ever been before have a great day
 people have been killed in sri lanka with more that badly injured in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels the united states offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of sri lanka we stand ready to help
do you believe this the new york times oped media and democrats owe trump an apology well they got that one right
the trump haters and angry democrats who wrote the mueller report were devastated by the no collusion finding nothing but a total hit job which should never have been allowed to start in the first place
despite no collusion no obstruction the radical left democrats do not want to go on to legislate for the good of the people but only to investigate and waste time this is costing our country greatly and will cost the dems big time in 
jobless claims in the united states have reached their lowest best level in over years
can you believe that i had to go through the worst and most corrupt political witch hunt in the history of the united states no collusion when it was the other side that illegally created the diversionary criminal event and even spied on my campaign disgraceful
how do you impeach a republican president for a crime that was committed by the democrats make america great again
so true thanks 
saudi arabia and others in opec will more than make up the oil flow difference in our now full sanctions on iranian oil iran is being given very bad advice by and people who helped him lead the us into the very bad iran nuclear deal big violation of logan act
only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment there were no crimes by me no collusion no obstruction so you cant impeach it was the democrats that committed the crimes not your republican president tables are finally turning on the witch hunt
thank you twittercomkffhfgkp

southern border crisis twittercomwqtper
the obama administration did not do itself proud in this twittercomidiveqfv
a very exculpatory section of the mueller report no conspiracy coordination or collusion with the trump campaign and the russians you cant be more clear than that twittercombcfctddrp
isnt it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before mueller the reason is that the angry democrats knew they would all say no collusion and only very good things
today melania and i are honored to host the easter egg roll

presidential harassment 
paul krugman of the fake news new york times has lost all credibility as has the times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me he is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is he said market would crash only record highs

i will be going to green bay wisconsin for a really big rally on saturday evening big crowd expected much to talk about make america great again
the radical left democrats together with their leaders in the fake news media have gone totally insane i guess that means that the republican agenda is working stay tuned for more
in the old days if you were president and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism remember its the economy stupid today i have as president perhaps the greatest economy in historyand to the mainstream media it means nothing but it will
sorry to say but is by far the best of the morning political shows on television it rightfully has by far the highest ratings not even close morning psycho joe who helped get me elected in by having me on free all the time has nosedived too angry
dumb and sick a really bad show with low ratings and will only get worse cnn has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster in fact it rewarded chris cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning only on cnn
harley davidson has struggled with tariffs with the eu currently paying theyve had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that tariff that theyve been hit with which will rise to in june of so unfair to us we will reciprocate
the best thing ever to happen to twitter is donald trump so true but they dont treat me well as a republican very discriminatory hard for people to sign on constantly taking people off list big complaints from many people different namesover m
but should be much higher than that if twitter wasnt playing their political games no wonder congress wants to get involved and they should must be more and fairer companies to get out the word
the wall is being rapidly built the economy is great our country is respected again

a very big caravan of over people started up through mexico it has been reduced in size by mexico but is still coming mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the border call up the military the coyotes cartels have weapons
mexicos soldiers recently pulled guns on our national guard soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border better not happen again we are now sending armed soldiers to the border mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending returning
the mueller report despite being written by angry democrats and trump haters and with unlimited money behind it didnt lay a glove on me i did nothing wrong if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach i would first head to the us supreme court not only
are there no high crimes and misdemeanors there are no crimes by me at all all of the crimes were committed by crooked hillary the dems the dnc and dirty cops and we caught them in the act we waited for mueller and won so now the dems look to congress as last hope
can anyone comprehend what a great job border patrol and law enforcement is doing on our southern border so far this year they have apprehended plus illegal immigrants way up from last year mexico is doing very little for us dems in congress must act now
no collusion no obstruction there has never been a president who has been more transparent millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems plus i allowed everyone to testify including wh counsel i didnt have to do this but now they want more
congress has no time to legislate they only want to continue the witch hunt which i have already won they should start looking at the criminals who are already very well known to all this was a rigged system we will drain the swamp
i didnt call bob costa of the washington post he called me returned his call just more fake news

mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what i and many others say was an illegal investigation there was no crime headed by a trump hater who was highly conflicted and a group of very angry democrats drain the swamp
despite the fact that the mueller report was composed by trump haters and angry democrats who had unlimited funds and human resources the end result was no collusion no obstruction amazing

people are fleeing new york state because of high taxes and yes even oppression of sorts they didnt even put up a fight against salt could have won so much litigation the nra should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with unfair state
ill never get the support of dues crazy union leadership those people who ripoff their membership with ridiculously high dues medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune but the members love trump they look at our record economy tax reg cuts military etc win

bob mueller was a great hero to the radical left democrats now that the mueller report is finished with a finding of no collusion no obstruction based on a review of report by our highly respected ag the dems are going around saying bob who sorry dont know the man
the new york times has apologized for the terrible antisemitic cartoon but they havent apologized to me for this or all of the fake and corrupt news they print on a daily basis they have reached the lowest level of journalism and certainly a low point in history
pittsburgh jobless rate hits lowest point since the early s maybe even better than that and sleepy joe just had his first rally there fact is every economic aspect of our country is the best it has ever been 
the coyotes and drug cartels are in total control of the mexico side of the southern border they have labs nearby where they make drugs to sell into the us mexico one of the most dangerous countrys in the world must eradicate this problem now also stop the march to us
if the democrats dont give us the votes to change our weak ineffective and dangerous immigration laws we must fight hard for these votes in the election
we have isis prisoners taken hostage in our final battles to destroy of the caliphate in syria decisions are now being made as to what to do with these dangerous prisoners
european countries are not helping at all even though this was very much done for their benefit they are refusing to take back prisoners from their specific countries not good
china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go
up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point and some quantitative easing yes we are doing very well at gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records at the same time make our national debt start to look small

why didnt president obama do something about russia in september before november election when told by the fbi he did nothing and had no intention of doing anything

ok so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible its time to get back to business the mueller report strongly stated that there was no collusion with russia of course and in fact they were rebuffed
at every turn in attempts to gain access but now republicans and democrats must come together for the good of the american people no more costly time consuming investigations lets do immigration border infrastructure much lower drug prices much more and do it now

of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no
after spending more than over a two year period interviewing people using trump hating angry democrats fbi agents all culminating in a more than page report showing no collusion why would the democrats in congress now need robert mueller
to testify are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong no collusion conclusion there was no crime except on the other side incredibly not covered in the report and no obstruction bob mueller should not testify no redos for the dems
the report sounded an awful lot as being comeyesque in other words im not going to charge this person there wasnt even close to being a crime but im going to criticize him on the way out the door thats unfortunate because its stepping outside of the role robert ray
this is not congressional oversight this is bullying jason riley the wall street journal
pending the confirmation of mark morgan as our nations new ice director matt albence will serve in the role of acting director matt is tough and dedicated and has my full support to deploy ice to the maximum extent of the law

real estate developers in the s s more than years ago were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would if one was actively building show losses and tax losses in almost all cases much was non monetary sometimes considered tax shelter 
you would get it by building or even buying you always wanted to show losses for tax purposesalmost all real estate developers did and often renegotiate with banks it was sport additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate fake news hit job
the reason for the china pullback attempted renegotiation of the trade deal is the sincere hope that they will be able to negotiate with joe biden or one of the very weak democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the united states billion a year for years to come
guess what thats not going to happen china has just informed us that they vicepremier are now coming to the us to make a deal well see but i am very happy with over billion a year in tariffs filling us coffersgreat for us not good for china

republicans must stick together 
we have lost billion dollars a year for many years on crazy trade with china no more
vp mike pence will be interviewed on at am enjoy
talks with china continue in a very congenial manner there is absolutely no need to rush as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of on billion dollars worth of goods products these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the us
the process has begun to place additional tariffs at on the remaining billion dollars the us only sells china approximately billion dollars of goods products a very big imbalance with the over billion dollars in tariffs that we take in we will buy
agricultural products from our great farmers in larger amounts than china ever did and ship it to poor starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance in the meantime we will continue to negotiate with china in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal
tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind also much easier quicker to do our farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source
tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch in the meantime china should not renegotiate deals with the us at the last minute this is not the obama administration or the administration of sleepy joe who let china get away with murder
the average k balance has soared since the bottom of the market wow
if we bought billion dollars of agriculture from our farmers far more than china buys now we would have more than billion dollars left over for new infrastructure healthcare or anything else china would greatly slow down and we would automatically speed up
build your products in the united states and there are no tariffs
your all time favorite president got tired of waiting for china to help out and start buying from our farmers the greatest anywhere in the world
great consumer price index just out really good very low inflation we have a great chance to really rock good numbers all around
looks to me like its going to be sleepycreepy joe over crazy bernie everyone else is fading fast
we have been engaged in an unfair relationship with china for a long time they have reneged on the commitments they made to the wto particularly around intellectual property carly fiorina 
great republican vote today on disaster relief bill we will now work out a bipartisan solution that gets relief for our great states and farmers thank you to all get me a bill that i can quickly sign
over the course of the past two days the united states and china have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries the relationship between president xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations
into the future will continue in the meantime the united states has imposed tariffs on china which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations
military spouses share an admirable legacy of unwavering devotion to their loved ones in uniform and to the cause of freedom on military spouse day we honor our nations military spouses and express our deep appreciation for all that they do 
such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa its very simple
i won the election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit which i still am and the voters didnt care now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter make it a part of the election
so now the radical left dems dont talk about collusion anymore because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime except for the crimes committed by the other side
i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election to see if they could get lucky have a democrat win in which case they would continue to ripoff the usa for billion a year
the only problem is that they know i am going to win best economy employment numbers in us history much more and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs
i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller never a big fan
the democrats have nothing just want to distract from this president the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary at the end of the day theyre fearful of what they did and should be fearful this is a tough
president who is willing to have the battle and we have a great attorney general who is willing to lead the battle and they are going to get to the bottom of it 
think of it i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation from long before i ever took office i was under a sick unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian
hoax my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction this must never be allowed to happen again
big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media not good
really sad 
we are right where we want to be with china remember they broke the deal with us tried to renegotiate we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa ideal or buy it from nontariffed countries
we will then spend match or better the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers agriculture which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world great 
the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a constitutional crisis they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible they are a sad joke we may have the strongest economy in our history best
employment numbers ever low taxes regulations a rebuilt military va many great new judges so much more but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax that is the constitutional crisis hopefully guilty people will pay
despite two years and millions of dollars spent the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started it is all a big hoax the biggest in american history
ever since the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason thats all they want to do dont care about anything else
when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia of course it was supposed to be over back to work for the people but the dems have gone nuts and it has actually gotten worse hope the republicans win back the house in or little will get done
the constitutional crisis is the democrats refusing to work let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border
china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in they love ripping off america
even director james clapper admits that the fbi actions against the trump presidential campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying perhaps fbi director christopher wray will be the next to do so 
just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the democrats that began during the obama administration continued through the mueller fbi operation now the baton has been passed to jerry nadler to continue to abuse power to harass president trump
and the democrat national committeethe democrat party apparatushas been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent me the fbi has no leadership the director is protecting the same gangthat tried to
overthrow the president through an illegal coup recommended by previous doj 
its the attack strategy of harass this is not about the attorney general who is very sophisticated knows it isnt about him its about trying to destroy president trump through an assault on his ag for upholding the rule of law he released a massive amount of
information as long as president trump is president his opposition will use every tool and misuse every tool available to make his life miserable sadly this proves i am doing a great job also best economy and employment numbers ever
i say openly to president xi all of my many friends in china that china will be hurt very badly if you dont make a deal because companies will be forced to leave china for other countries too expensive to buy in china you had a great deal almost completed you backed out
thank you great show this morning and congratulations on your number one by far rating well deserved
also congratulations to on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump thank you president trump
the unexpectedly good first quarter gdp was greatly helped by tariffs from china some people just dont get it
has anyone noticed that all the boston have done is win since coming to the white house others also have done very well the white house visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of sports illustrated by the way the boston players were great guys
bernie sanders the economy is doing well and im sure i dont have to give trump any credit im sure hell take all the credit that he wants wrong bernie the economy is doing great and would have crashed if my opponent and yours crooked hillary clinton had ever won
democrat rep tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the holocaust she obviously has tremendous hatred of israel and the jewish people can you imagine what would happen if i ever said what she said and says
there is no reason for the us consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only points were paid by the us points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be
completely avoided if you buy from a nontariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea thats zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia thats why china wants to make a deal so badly
there will be nobody left in china to do business with very bad for china very good for usa but china has taken so advantage of the us for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliatewill only get worse
my administration will be fighting for million for the army corps everglades restoration work this year congress needs to help us complete the worlds largest intergovernmental watershed restoration project asap good for florida and good for the environment

in one year tariffs have rebuilt our steel industry it is booming we placed a tariff on dumped steel from china other countries and we now have a big and growing industry we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong
china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff you can also buy from a nontariffed country instead of china many companies are leaving china
so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great election we are the piggy bank that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of no more
we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal no way we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made will be taking in
billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong other countries are already negotiating with us because they dont want this to happen to them they must be a part of usa action this should have been done by our leaders many years ago enjoy
when the time is right we will make a deal with china my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just doesnt make any sense we have to be allowed to make up some
of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto it will all happen and much faster than people think
our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy
this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us the farmers have been forgotten for many years their time is now
china will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing if the federal reserve ever did a match it would be game over we win in any event china wants a deal
our great senator and star from the state of arkansas has just completed a wonderful book sacred duty about arlington national cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion on sale today make it big

the fake news media is hurting our country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of iran it is scattershot poorly sourced made up and dangerous at least iran doesnt know what to think which at this point may very well be a good thing
it now seems the general flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge it would have been impossible for me to know this but if that was the case and with me being one of two people who would become president why was i not told so that i could make a change

conditions drug prices down for first time in years soon will drop much further right to try protecting your nd amendment big tax reg cuts gdp strong foreign policy much much more that nobody else would have been able to do our country is doing great
never a fan of a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy if he actually read the biased mueller report composed by angry dems who hated trump
he would see that it was nevertheless strong on no collusion and ultimately no obstructionanyway how do you obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands
watched some of the fake news political shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way the mainstream media should be ashamed of itself but the good news is that the usa is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception

starting monday our great farmers can begin doing business again with mexico and canada they have both taken the tariff penalties off of your great agricultural product please be sure that you are treated fairly any complaints should immediately go to perdue
the mainstream media hates to cover this 
the failing new york times it will pass away when i leave office in years and others of the fake news media keep writing phony stories about how i didnt use many banks because they didnt want to do business with me wrong it is because i didnt need money very old
fashioned but true when you dont need or want money you dont need or want banks banks have always been available to me they want to make money fake media only says this to disparage and always uses unnamed sources because their sources dont even exist
the mainstream media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today fake news is actually the biggest story of all and is the true enemy of the people thats why they refuse to cover the real russia hoax but the american people are wise to what is going on
now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesnt need banks but where did he get all of that cash could it be russia no i built a great business and dont need banks but if i did they would be thereand deutschebank
was very good and highly professional to deal with and if for any reason i didnt like them i would have gone elsewherethere was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from they would be very happy to take my money fake news
we have a booming economy and working people are making gains that they havent seen in decades stuart varney 
why are the democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by crooked hillary and the phony russia investigation they would get back their credibility jerry nadler schiff would have a whole new future open to them perhaps they could even run for president

iran will call us if and when they are ever ready in the meantime their economy continues to collapse very sad for the iranian people

i am very disappointed that mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our southern border where everyone knows that because of the democrats our immigration laws are totally flawed broken
mexicos attitude is that people from other countries including mexico should have the right to flow into the us that us taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated wthis illegal migration mexico is wrong and i will soon be giving a response
pennsylvania dont forget to get out and vote today for republican fred keller for congress fred is strong on crime second amendment military vets and healthcare he has my complete and total endorsement
i am pleased to announce my nomination of barbara barrett of arizona and former chairman of the aerospace corporation to be the next secretary of the air force she will be an outstanding secretary 
so even though i didnt have to do it with presidential privilege i allowed everyone to testify including white house counsel don mcgahn for over hours to robert mueller and the angry trumphating democrats and they arrived
at a conclusion of no collusion and no obstruction the dems were unhappy with the outcome of the m mueller report so now they want a doover
johnny we will miss you you did a great job 
wow mark levins new book opened at it is great keep it there for a long time 
shahira knight has done a wonderful job as my legislative affairs director at the white house she was outstanding for us and for our country will be a tremendous success in the private sector
after spending million dollars reviewing million pages of documents interviewing people with the total support of the white house the mueller report was a big disappointment to the democrats so they want a do over it doesnt work that wayso bad for our country
the democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with robert mueller and the angry dems never happened to a president before never even happened to president obama
john brennan on the mueller probe i dont know if i received bad information but i think i suspected that there was more than there actually was wow he admits he was wrong congress should go back to work on drug prices etc
great news for republicans fred keller has just won the hard fought for pennsylvania congressional contest in a landslide over of the vote thanks to the thousands who showed up for the rally last night congratulations to fred and his wonderful family
congratulations to governor on winning the republican primary for governor tonight in the great state of kentucky matt you are doing a fantastic job
everything the democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the mueller report came back with a no collusion finding now they say impeach president trump even though he did nothin wrong while they fish
after two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt the democrats dont like the result and they want a do over in other words the witch hunt continues
the democrats are getting zero work done in congress all they are focused on is trying to prove the mueller report wrong the witch hunt
presidential harassment
without the illegal witch hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically great economy would be at too bad the greatest hoax in american history
much of the wall being built at the southern border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new wall and footings problem is the haters say that is not a new wall but rather a renovation wrong and we must build where most needed
also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation fixing existing walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard
everybody including me thought that when the million dollar mueller report was released with no collusion and no obstruction of a crime caused by others that was the end but no the democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in bad for the country
the democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases they ought to start governing you know for a change michael goodwin 
he jerry nadler wants a show he wants to use mr mcgahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that mr trump tried to obstruct the mueller investigation yet mr mueller wasnt obstructed in any way his copious report was released for all to see there was no collusion
between russia and the trump campaign mr mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr nadlers pseudoimpeachment drama wall street journal editorial board today may 
as i have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a witch hunt against the republican party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us
so sad that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our country they can continue the witch hunt which has already cost m and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in america or get back to work
but they really want a doover you cant investigate and legislate simultaneously it just doesnt work that way you cant go down two tracks at the same time let chuck nancy jerry adam and all of the rest finish playing their games
in the meantime my administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the greatest economy in our countrys history
democrat leadership is tearing the united states apart but i will continue to set records for the american people and nancy thank you so much for your prayers i know you truly mean it
i want to welcome you all to the as we award our very bravest law enforcement officers and firefighters our nations highest public safety award the medal of valor 
in a letter to her house colleagues nancy pelosi said president trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see this is not true i was purposely very polite and calm much as i was minutes later with the press in the rose garden can be easily proven it is all such a lie
zero is getting done with the democrats in charge of the house all they want to do is put the mueller report behind them and start all over again no doovers
democrats dont want to fix the loopholes at the border they dont want to do anything open borders and crime
the democrats are getting nothing done in congress all of their effort is about a redo of the mueller report which didnt turn out the way they wanted it is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time their heart is not into infrastructure lower
drug prices preexisting conditions and our great vets all they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me a pure fishing expedition like this never happened before it should never happen again
the democrats have become known as the do nothing party
rex tillerson a man who is dumb as a rock and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be secretary of state made up a story he got fired that i was outprepared by vladimir putin at a meeting in hamburg germany i dont think putin would agree look how the us is doing
i was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with pelosi and schumer knowing that they would say i was raging which they always do along with their partner the fake news media well so many stories about the meeting use the rage narrative anyway fake corrupt press
when the democrats in congress refinish for the th time their fake work on their very disappointing mueller report finding they will have the time to get the real work of the people done move quickly
our hearts go out to the people of missouri as they woke up to assess the damage from storms you are strong and resilient and we are here to assist 
 and are monitoring the damaging storms and flooding in oklahoma listen to the warnings of your local officials and stay safe we are with you
congratulations to prime minister and his bjp party on their big election victory great things are in store for the usindia partnership with the return of pm modi at the helm i look forward to continuing our important work together
we will never forget our fallen heroes it was our great honor to be with you today

 poll a majority of americans want the democrats to stop investigating president trump the mueller report said very strongly no collusion which led to no obstruction the dems cant get over or the conclusive mueller findings they are now the do nothing party
today at the request and recommendation of the attorney general of the united states president donald j trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the attorney generals investigation into surveillance activities

republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the senate seat in the great state of alabama this time it will be for six years not just two i have nothing against roy moore and unlike many other republican leaders wanted him to win but he didnt and probably wont
if alabama does not elect a republican to the senate in many of the incredible gains that we have made during my presidency may be lost including our prolife victories roy moore cannot win and the consequences will be devastatingjudges and supreme court justices
nothing changes from the mueller report there was insufficient evidence and therefore in our country a person is innocent the case is closed thank you

i was not informed about anything having to do with the navy ship uss john s mccain during my recent visit to japan nevertheless and i loved being with our great military men and women what a spectacular job they do
the greatest presidential harassment in history after spending over two dark years with unlimited access people resources and cooperation highly conflicted robert mueller would have brought charges if he had anything but there were no charges to bring
russia russia russia thats all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoaxand now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected it was a crime that didnt exist so now the dems and their partner the fake news media
say he fought back against this phony crime that didnt exist this horrendous false accusation and he shouldnt fight back he should just sit back and take it could this be obstruction no mueller didnt find obstruction either presidential harassment
congressman john ratcliffe the trump campaign clearly did not conspire or collude 
comey and brennan are turning on each other

sean davis the federalist mueller proved his entire operation was a political hit job still zero evidence of trumprussia collusion and no new evidence from mueller 
congratulations to the class of 
hard to believe that with the crisis on the border the dems wont do the quick and easy fix would solve the problem but they want open borders which equals crime
mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the us have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done
in order not to pay tariffs if they start rising companies will leave mexico which has taken of our auto industry and come back home to the usa mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels the tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals
 of the drugs coming into the united states come through mexico our southern border people died last year people ruined this has gone on for many years nothing has been done about it we have a billion dollar trade deficit with mexico its time

washington post got it wrong as usual the us is charging against billion dollars of goods shipped from china not bd also china is paying a heavy cost in that they will subsidize goods to keep them coming devalue their currency yet companies are moving to
us in order to avoid paying the tariff like mexican companies will move back to the united states once the tariff reaches the higher levels they took many of our companies jobs the foolish pols let it happen and now they will come back unless mexico stops the
travesty that is taking place in allowing millions of people to easily meander through their country and invade the us not to mention the drugs human trafficking pouring in through mexico are the drug lords cartels coyotes really running mexico we will soon find out
when you are the piggy bank nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years the word tariff is a beautiful word indeed others must treat the united states fairly and with respect we are no longer the fools of the past

the democrats are doing nothing on the border to address the humanitarian and national security crisis could be fixed so easily if they would vote with republicans to fix the loopholes
people have been saying for years that we should talk to mexico the problem is that mexico is an abuser of the united states taking but never giving it has been this way for decades either they stop the invasion of our country by drug dealers cartels human traffickers
coyotes and illegal immigrants which they can do very easily or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move south of the border will be brought back into the united states through taxation tariffs america has had enough
the wall is under construction and moving along quickly despite all of the radical liberal democrat lawsuits what are they thinking as our country is invaded by so many people illegals and things drugs that we do not want make america great again

plagiarism charge against sleepy joe biden on his ridiculous climate change plan is a big problem but the corrupt media will save him his other problem is that he is drawing flies not people to his rallies nobody is showing up i mean nobody you cant win without people
i kept hearing that there would be massive rallies against me in the uk but it was quite the opposite the big crowds which the corrupt media hates to show were those that gathered in support of the usa and me they were big enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops
 melania and i send our deepest condolences to president reuven rivlin and the entire state of israel upon the passing of mrs nechama rivlin mrs rivlin represented her beloved country with grace and stature we will miss her along with all those who knew her

house democrats fresh off a republican victory against them in federal court on the wall keep asking people to come and testify regarding the no collusion witch hunt they are very unhappy with the mueller report especially with his corrective letter now want a do over
if the totally corrupt media was less corrupt i would be up by points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe best ever if the corrupt media was actually fair i would be up by points nevertheless despite the fake news were doing great
house republicans support the president on tariffs with mexico all the way that makes any measure the president takes on the border totally veto proof why wouldnt you as republicans support him when that will allow our president to make a better deal thank you

immigration discussions at the white house with representatives of mexico have ended for the day progress is being made but not nearly enough border arrests for may are at because of mexico the democrats in congress refusing to budge on immigration reform further

nervous nancy pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement especially since i was with foreign leaders overseas there is no evidence for such a thing to have been said nervous nancy dems are getting zero work done in congress
and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me both illegal unprecedented in us history there was no collusion investigate the investigators go to work on drug price reductions infrastructure
if we are able to make the deal with mexico there is a good chance that we will they will begin purchasing farm agricultural products at very high levels starting immediately if we are unable to make the deal mexico will begin paying tariffs at the level on monday
democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid immigration bill
for all of the money we are spending nasa should not be talking about going to the moon we did that years ago they should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing including mars of which the moon is a part defense and science
heading back to dc many great things are happening for our country
dow jones has best week of the year
i am pleased to inform you that the united states of america has reached a signed agreement with mexico the tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the us on monday against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended mexico in turn has agreed to take strong measures to
stem the tide of migration through mexico and to our southern border this is being done to greatly reduce or eliminate illegal immigration coming from mexico and into the united states details of the agreement will be released shortly by the state department thank you
while the reviews and reporting on our border immigration agreement with mexico have been very good there has nevertheless been much false reporting surprise by the fake and corrupt news media such as comcastnbc cnn these fakers are bad news
brandon judd national border patrol council thats going to be a huge deal because mexico will be using their strong immigration laws a game changer people no longer will be released into the us also mexican troops at their southern border currently there are few
mexico will try very hard and if they do that this will be a very successful agreement for both the united states and mexico
mexico has agreed to immediately begin buying large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers
nervous nancy pelosi the democrat house are getting nothing done perhaps they could lead the way with the usmca the spectacular very popular new trade deal that replaces nafta the worst trade deal in the history of the usa great for our farmers manufacturers unions
everyone very excited about the new deal with mexico
i would like to thank the president of mexico andres manuel lopez obrador and his foreign minister marcelo ebrard together with all of the many representatives of both the united states and mexico for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed
watched msnbc this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week such lies almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth fake news no wonder their ratings along with cnn are way down the hatred comcast has is amazing
just watched the great basketball hall of famer on the a wonderful interview of a very smart and interesting guy by the man mark levin who has the number one bestselling book unfreedom of the press two winners
little whose show like his previous shoebiz tries is a disaster has been saying that i had been a friend of his this is false he separately used to beg me to be on episodes of the apprentice both were bad but that was it hardly knew him
other than to know he was and is a total loser when he makes statements about me they are made up he knows nothing
i know it is not at all presidential to hit back at the corrupt media or people who work for the corrupt media when they make false statements about me or the trump administration problem is if you dont hit back people believe the fake news is true so well hit back
another false report in the failing we have been trying to get some of these border actions for a long time as have other administrations but were not able to get them or get them in full until our signed agreement with mexico additionally and for many years
mexico was not being cooperative on the border in things we had or didnt have and now i have full confidence especially after speaking to their president yesterday that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done importantly some things
not mentioned in yesterday press release one in particular were agreed upon that will be announced at the appropriate time there is now going to be great cooperation between mexico the usa something that didnt exist for decades however if for some unknown reason
there is not we can always go back to our previous very profitable position of tariffs but i dont believe that will be necessary the failing ratings challenged will do anything possible to see our country fail they are truly the enemy of the people
twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction its called freedom of speech remember you are making a giant mistake
if president obama made the deals that i have made both at the border and for the economy the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible a national holiday would be immediately declared with me despite our record setting economy and all that i have done no credit
for two years all the democrats talked about was the mueller report because they knew that it was loaded up with angry democrat trump haters later increased to but despite the bias when the report came out the findings were no collusion and facts that led to
no obstruction the dems were devastated after all this time and money spent the mueller report was a disaster for them but they want a redo or do over they are even bringing in sleazebag attorney john dean sorry no do overs go back to work
the failing story on mexico and illegal immigration through our southern border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it the only problem is that they knew it was fake news before it went out corrupt media
now with our new deal mexico is doing more for the usa on illegal immigration than the democrats in fact the democrats are doing nothing they want open borders which means illigal immigration drugs and crime
we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the us has been asking about getting for many years it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by mexicos legislative body
we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming tariffs will be reinstated
when will the failing new york times admit that their front page story on the the new mexico deal at the border is a fraud and nothing more than a badly reported hit job on me something that has been going on since the first day i announced for the presidency sick journalism
thank you and john eastman 
cant believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor no collusion no obstruction democrats just want a doover which theyll never get

new book just out the real deal my decade fighting battles and winning wars with trump is really wonderful it is written by two people who are very smart know me well george sorial damian bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who i am enjoy
jerry nadlers trump bashing show is a bust headline new york post the greatest witch hunt of all time continues all crimes were by the other side but the committee refuses to even take a look deleting emails is the real obstruction and much more
mueller has spoken he found no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians the bottom line is what the democrat house is doing is trying to destroy the trump presidency which has been a tremendous success and i can assure you that were done with the mueller
investigation in the senate they can talk to john dean until the cows come home were not doing anything in the senate regarding the mueller report we are going to harden our infrastructure against 
presidential harassment
sad when you think about it but mexico right now is doing more for the united states at the border than the democrats in congress 
the united states has very low inflation a beautiful thing
this is because the euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the us at a big disadvantage the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening they dont have a clue 
maria dagan steve stuart v when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and most importantly a powerful way to get
companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass but very happy with the deal i made
if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of tariff so far little effect to consumer companies will relocate to us
good day in the stock market people have no idea the tremendous potential our country has for growth and many other things
why did the democrats run if they didnt want to do things 
on my way to iowa just heard nearly agriculture groups signed a letter urging congress to approve the usmca our patriot farmers rural america have spoken now congress must do its job support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan usmca trade agreement

beautiful afternoon in iowa thank you to all of our nations farmers may god bless you and may god bless america 
someone should call obama up the obama administration spied on a rival presidential campaign using federal agencies i mean that seems like a headline to me it will all start coming out and the witch hunt will end presidential harassment
the fake corrupt news media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which by the way and despite the phony and never ending witch hunt are the best numbers we have ever had they reported fake numbers that they made up dont even exist we will win again

its about peace and prosperity thats how republican presidents get elected and this president has delivered on the economy and hes delivered on keeping america stronger safer our biggest enemy is not any one of these democrats its the media john mclaughlin pollster
general michael flynn the year war hero who has served with distinction has not retained a good lawyer he has retained a great lawyer sidney powell best wishes and good luck to them both
unrelated to russia russia russia although the radical left doesnt use the name russia anymore since the issuance of the mueller report house committee now plays the seldom used contempt card on our great ag sec of commerce this time on the census dems play a
much tougher game than the republicans did when they had the house majority republicans will remember this has already been argued before the us supreme court but the house doesnt want to wait this is a common thread between all of the committees do whatever you
can to embarrass the trump administration and republicans attack the trump administration this is campaigning by the dems attorney david bruno so true in the meantime they are getting no work done on drug pricing infrastructure many other things
congress cannot impeach president trump did nothing wrong because if they did they would be putting themselves above the law the constitution provides criteria for impeachment treason bribery high crimes misdemeanors unless there is compelling evidence impeachment
is not constitutionally permissable alan dershowitz constitutional lawyer
the dems fight us at every turn in the meantime they are accomplishing nothing for the people they have gone absolutely loco or unhinged as they like to say
i meet and talk to foreign governments every day i just met with the queen of england uk the prince of wales the pm of the united kingdom the pm of ireland the president of france and the president of poland we talked about everything should i immediately
call the fbi about these calls and meetings how ridiculous i would never be trusted again with that being said my full answer is rarely played by the fake news media they purposely leave out the part that matters
when senator spoke at length and in great detail about extremely negative information on me with a talented entertainer purporting to be a russian operative did he immediately call the fbi no in fact he didnt even tell the senate intelligence committee of
which he is a member when took calls from another person also very successfully purporting to be a russian operative did he call the fbi or even think to call the fbi no the fact is that the phony witch hunt is a giant scam where democrats
and other really bad people spied on my campaign they even had an insurance policy just in case crooked hillary clinton and the democrats lost their race for the presidency this is the biggest worst political scandal in the history of the united states of america sad
theyve been wrong all along 
while i very much appreciate pm abe going to iran to meet with ayatollah ali khamenei i personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal they are not ready and neither are we
it is the assessment of the us government that iran is responsible for today's attacks in the gulf of oman twittercomstibpkce

the latest polls find of americans approve of president trumps job performance last month a democrat pollster said president trumps approval rating has been the most steady of any president in history 
with over a approval rating at this point in his presidency analysts believe reelection in looks very promising hey we have accomplished more than any president in the first years why not
despite the greatest presidential harassment of all time by people that are very dishonest and want to destroy our country we are doing great in the polls even better than in and will be packed at the tuesday announcement rally in orlando florida keep america great

thank you steve family 
the corrupt news media is totally out of control they have given up and dont even care anymore mainstream media has zero credibility total losers
he is a national disgrace who is destroying the city of london 
i enjoyed my interview with on so funny to watch the fake news media try to dissect distort every word in as negative a way as possible it will be aired on sunday night at pm and is called president trump hours which is somewhat
misleading in that i personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews i do have a few other things to do you know think i will do many more network interviews as i did in in order to get the word out that no president has done what i have in
the first years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country it is called earned media in any event enjoy the show
do you believe that the failing new york times just did a story stating that the united states is substantially increasing cyber attacks on russia this is a virtual act of treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story any story even if bad for our country
also not true anything goes with our corrupt news media today they will do or say whatever it takes with not even the slightest thought of consequence these are true cowards and without doubt the enemy of the people
florida governor ron desantis just signed bill banning sanctuary cities in state forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities bill prohibits local govt from enacting sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants 
more and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders dont have the courage to do so the politics will soon mandate however because people from california all over the land are demanding that sanctuary cities be gone no illegals drugs or trafficking
congratulations to great guy pete hegseth and wonderful jenny cunningham on their engagement they will have a fantastic life together 
yesterday was the radical left democrats big impeachment day they worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem almost nobody showed up the media admits low turnout for antitrump rallies all around the country people are
saying enough democrat voters want to hear the politicians talking about issues this is a huge distraction and will only help donald trump get elected greatest president since ronald reagan said a counterprotester lehighvalleylive
a poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the failing new york times or the amazon lobbyist washington post they are both a disgrace to our country the enemy of the people but i just cant seem to figure out which is worse the good
news is that at the end of years after america has been made great again and i leave the beautiful white house do you think the people would demand that i stay longer keep america great both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business be forever gone
happy fathers day to all including my worst and most vicious critics of which there are fewer and fewer this is a fantastic time to be an american keep america great
thank you pm and the state of israel for this great honor 
when will the fake news media start asking democrats if they are ok with the hiring of christopher steele a foreign agent paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc to dig up dirt and write a phony dossier against the presidential candidate of the opposing party
if republicans ever did that to the democrats there would be all hell to pay it would be a scandal like no other
almost in new poll say dont impeach so ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side they cant win the election fairly
rep alexandria ocasiocortez i think we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to donald trump i agree and that is the only reason they play the impeach card which cannot be legally used
congratulations to gary woodland in winning the united states open golf championship fantastic playing great heart there will be more in garys future

next week ice will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the united states they will be removed as fast as they come in mexico using their strong immigration laws is doing a very good job of stopping people
long before they get to our southern border guatemala is getting ready to sign a safethird agreement the only ones who wont do anything are the democrats in congress they must vote to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum if so border crisis will end quickly
thousands of people are already lined up in orlando some two days before tomorrow nights big rally large screens and food trucks will be there for those that cant get into the capacity arena it will be a very exciting evening make america great again
the story in the about the us escalating attacks on russias power grid is fake news and the failing new york times knows it they should immediately release their sources which if they exist at all which i doubt are phony times must be held fully accountable
wow the state department said it has identified security incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of crooked hillary clintons emails this is really big never admitted before highly classified material will the dems investigate this
only a few people showed up for the socalled impeachment rallies over the weekend the numbers were anemic no spirit no hope more importantly no collusion no obstruction
mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others
european markets rose on comments unfair to us made today by mario d
the fake news doesnt report it but republican enthusiasm is at an all time high look what is going on in orlando florida right now people have never seen anything like it unless you play a guitar going to be wild see you later
had a very good telephone conversation with president xi of china we will be having an extended meeting next week at the g in japan our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting

on no issue are democrats more extreme and more depraved than when it comes to border security the democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible it is the great betrayal of the american middle class and our country as a whole twittercomfrjhppj
in the ultimate act of moral cowardice not one democrat candidate for president not a single one has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ice and border patrol they dont have the character the virtue or the spine twittercomoulnnvtxmw
dont ever forget this election is about you it is about your family your future the fate of your country we begin our campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda the only positive vision for our countrys future twittercomvmuhkqh
thank you 
the dems are very unhappy with the mueller report so after almost years they want a redo or do over this is extreme presidential harassment they gave crooked hillarys people complete immunity yet now they bring back hope hicks why arent the dems looking at the
 emails that hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed after getting a subpoena from congress that is real obstruction that the dems want no part of because their hearings are rigged and a disgrace to our country
democrat congressional hearings are 
if i didnt have the phony witch hunt going on for years and if the fake news media and their partner in crime the democrats would have played it straight i would be way up in the polls right now with our economy winning by points but im winning anyway
so sad that the democrats are putting wonderful hope hicks through hell for years now after total exoneration by robert mueller the mueller report they were unhappy with result so they want a do over very unfair costly to her will it ever end why arent they
asking hillary clinton why she deleted and acid washed her emails after getting a subpoena from congress anybody else would be in jail for that yet the dems refuse to even bring it up rigged house committee
i will be interviewed live tonight by on pm enjoy
just returning from orlando and doral miami florida and heading to the oval office where i will present the great economist dr arthur laffer with the presidential medal of freedom
congratulations to president lopez obrador mexico voted to ratify the usmca today by a huge margin time for congress to do the same here

sp opens at record high
the president has a really good story to tell we have unemployment lower than weve seen in decades we have people who stopped looking for work coming back into the labor force we are in a record growth period michael steel do you believe
iran made a very big mistake
it was my great honor to host canadian prime minister at the today 
sp closes at record high 
just revealed that the failing and desperate new york times was feeding false stories about me those associated with me to the fbi this shows the kind of unprecedented hatred i have been putting up with for years with this crooked newspaper is what they have done legal
this russia collusion hoax was perpetrated in part by people inside the government and in part by a compliant fake news media mollie hemingway the facts are starting to pour out stay tuned
president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them billion dollars plus i billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled
death to america i terminated deal which was not even ratified by congress and imposed strong sanctions they are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my presidency when they were causing major problems throughout the middle east now they are bust
on monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters we were cocked loaded to retaliate last night on different sights when i asked how many will die people sir was the answer from a general minutes before the strike i stopped it not
proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new and ready to go by far the best in the world sanctions are biting more added last night iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world
the people that ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported this means that they have run from the law and run from the courts these are people that are supposed to go back to their home country they broke the law by coming into the country now by staying
when people come into our country illegally they will be deported
stock market is on track to have the best june in over years thank you mr president 
looking good we must win to keep america great 
a great book 
thank you jessica 
i am at camp david working on many things including iran we have a great economy tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge dollars coming in on helping to make good trade deals the dow heading to best june in years stock market best june in years
iran cannot have nuclear weapons under the terrible obama plan they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years and existing verification is not acceptable we are putting major additional sanctions on iran on monday i look forward to the day that
sanctions come off iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again the sooner the better
at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process deportation for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border if not deportations start
i never called the strike against iran back as people are incorrectly reporting i just stopped it from going forward at this time
i want to give the democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes this will fix the southern border together with the help that mexico is now giving us probably wont happen but worth a try two weeks and big deportation begins
wonderful church service at camp david thank you
when our country had no debt and built everything from highways to the military with cash we had a big system of tariffs now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs but no more the usa is doing great with unlimited upside into the future
china gets of its oil from the straight japan many other countries likewise so why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries many years for zero compensation all of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been
a dangerous journey we dont even need to be there in that the us has just become by far the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world the us request for iran is very simple no nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror
despite a federal reserve that doesnt know what it is doing raised rates far too fast very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering easing did large scale tightening billionmonth we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history
think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the s or even s now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us blew it
i am pleased to announce the launch of this new platform will allow my campaign and other republicans to compete with the democrats money machine this has been a priority of mine and im pleased to share that it is up and running 
stock market is heading for one of the best months june in the history of our country thank you mr president
iran leadership doesnt understand the words nice or compassion they never have sadly the thing they do understand is strength and power and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world with trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone
the wonderful iranian people are suffering and for no reason at all their leadership spends all of its money on terror and little on anything else the us has not forgotten irans use of ieds efps bombs which killed americans and wounded many more
irans very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force in some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration no more john kerry obama
a brave former fighter jet pilot and warrior senator martha mcsally of arizona has done an outstanding job in dc and is fully supportive of our agenda she is with us all the way

presidential harassment
wow did great in the ratings cnn is dead as a door nail no credibility and msnbc is dying fast and are doing great 
too bad the dems in congress wont do anything at all about border security they want open borders which means crime but we are getting it done including building the wall more people than ever before are coming because the usa economy is so good the best in history
i will be interviewed by today at am on enjoy
democrats want open borders which equals violent crime drugs and human trafficking they also want very high taxes like republicans want whats good for america the exact opposite
womens soccer player just stated that she is not going to the fing white house if we win other than the nba which now refuses to call owners owners please explain that i just got criminal justice reform passed black unemployment is at the lowest level
in our countrys history and the poverty index is also best number ever leagues and teams love coming to the white house i am a big fan of the american team and womens soccer but megan should win first before she talks finish the job we havent yet
invited megan or the team but i am now inviting the team win or lose megan should never disrespect our country the white house or our flag especially since so much has been done for her the team be proud of the flag that you wear the usa is doing great
it was my great honor to speak at the faith freedom coalition conference today in washington dc thank you 
the democrats should change the loopholes and asylum laws so lives will be saved at our southern border they said it was not a crisis at the border that it was all just manufactured now they admit that i was right but they must do something about it fix the laws now
just departed for the summit in osaka japan 
the democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very dangerous immigration laws it can be done instantly
i have been in office for many years the military is very important to me and at no time in my professional life has the us military been as strong as it is right now thank you 
according to fake news and low ratings democrats say hearings could change impeachment debate thats because they have lost the impeachment debate say no and they are hoping that yet another do over after years and will turn things around
no collusion no obstruction robert mueller said he was done after his last minute news conference as later corrected now the dems want to give it another try does it ever end
the republican senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our southern border in addition to aid congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the crisis we must end incentives for smuggling children trafficking women and selling drugs
why arent the democrats in the house calling comey brennan clapper page and her fbi lover whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted crooked hillary podesta ohr and nellie the gps fusion characters christopher steele the dnc their missing server
and all of the others who have leaked lied and did so many other terrible things how is it even possible that these people are not being brought forward because it is a rigged democrat con game and the fake and corrupt media loves every minute of it
for tonights be sure to follow and for rapid response fact checking and the truth sorry im on air force one off to save the free world
ever since the passage of the super predator crime bill pushed hard by together with bill and crooked hillary clinton which inflicted great pain on many but especially the african american community democrats have tried and failed to pass criminal justice reform
they came to me asking for help and i got criminal justice reform passed with help from both republicans and democrats many said that nobody but president trump could have done this all previous administrations failed please ask why they failed to the candidates
 what now for those who denied a 'crisis' at the border 
these flyers depict australias policy on illegal immigration much can be learned 
boring
 and should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization which they are
just stopped in alaska and said hello to our great troops 
i look forward to speaking with prime minister modi about the fact that india for years having put very high tariffs against the united states just recently increased the tariffs even further this is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn
thank you real professionals twittercomzckcuqya
thank you 
seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive detailed and important census in this case for i have asked the lawyers if they can delay the census no matter how long until the
united states supreme court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter can anyone really believe that as a great country we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a citizen only in america
bipartisan humanitarian aid bill for the southern border just passed a great job done by all now we must work to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum thank you also to mexico for the work being done on helping with illegal immigration a very big difference
great to be back in japan for the twittercomzuwlaumaq
all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare how about taking care of american citizens first thats the end of that race
the stock market went up massively from the day after i won the election all the way up to the day that i took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that i was going to be president that big stock market increase must be credited to me if hillary won a big crash
i am in japan at the g representing our country well but i heard it was not a good day for sleepy joe or crazy bernie one is exhausted the other is nuts so whats the big deal
 in poll i would be at with our great economy maybe the best ever if not for the phony witch hunt and the fake news media
after some very important meetings including my meeting with president xi of china i will be leaving japan for south korea with president moon while there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the borderdmz just to shake his hand and say hello
thank you twittercomfcqsurbp
i had a great meeting with president xi of china yesterday far better than expected i agreed not to increase the already existing tariffs that we charge china while we continue to negotiate china has agreed that during the negotiation they will begin purchasing large
amounts of agricultural product from our great farmers at the request of our high tech companies and president xi i agreed to allow chinese company huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our national security importantly we have opened up negotiations
again with china as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one the quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed i am in no hurry but things look very good there will be no reduction in the tariffs currently being charged to china
i am in south korea now president moon and i have toasted our new trade deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced today i will visit with and speak to our troops and also go to the the dmz long planned my meeting with president moon went very well
the highly respected farm journal has just announced my approval rating with our great farmers at and that despite all of the fake corrupt news that they are forced to endure farmers have been unfairly treated for many years and that is turning around fast
the leaders of virtually every country that i met at the g congratulated me on our great economy many countries are having difficulties on that score we have the best economy anywhere in the world with great unlimited potential looking into the future
leaving south korea after a wonderful meeting with chairman kim jong un stood on the soil of north korea an important statement for all and a great honor
so many amazing things happened over the last three days all or at least most of those things are great for the united states much was accomplished
stocks cap best first half since our country is doing great
congratulations to legislators in new jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state many were planning to leave will now be staying new york others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast
thank you to president moon of south korea for hosting the american delegation and me immediately following the very successful g in japan while there it was great to call on chairman kim of north korea to have our very well covered meeting good things can happen for all
congratulations to prime minister abe of japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run g there wasnt a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made perfect the people of japan must be very proud of their prime minister
in my opinion the president has done more good on the korean issue in the last year and a half than president obama did in eight years if you look at the strides they made during the obama years which advocated strategic patiencethey stuck their head in the sand this is
why president trump has to deal with north korea the way it is now he had to figure out what to do with the korea mess i think this is why the president deserves a lot of credit harry kazianis center for the national interest thank you
it is very hard and expensive to live in new york governor andrew cuomo uses his attorney general as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes they sue on everything always in search of a crime i even got sued on a foundation which took zero rent expenses gave away
more money than it had going on for years originally brought by crooked hillarys campaign chair ag eric schneiderman until forced to resign for abuse against women they never even looked at the disgusting clinton foundation now cuomos ag is harassing all of my
new york businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible so on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers no wonder people and businesses are fleeing new york in record numbers
thats right the trump foundation gave away plus with zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by cuomo and new york state for years another part of the political witch hunt just in case anyone is interested clinton foundation never even looked at
i am excited to announce that will soon be joining our campaign she feels so strongly about our country its future we are setting records in so many ways we will keep it going mercedes has done a fantastic job within the administration i am so thankful
it was great being with chairman kim jong un of north korea this weekend we had a great meeting he looked really well and very healthy i look forward to seeing him again soon
in the meantime our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems no rush but i am sure we will ultimately get there
i will be interviewed by tonight at pm on 
people are fleeing new york like never before if they own a business they are twice as likely to flee and if they are a victim of harassment by the ag of the state like what they are doing to our great nra which i think will move quickly to texas where they are loved
texas will defend them indemnify them against political harassment by new york state and governor cuomo so many people are leaving new york for texas and florida that it is totally under siege first new york taxes you too high then they sue you just to complete the job
mark levin has written a big number one bestselling book called conspicuously and accurately unfreedom of the press it is a great book that tells it like it is fake news and all keep this book number one
as most people are aware according to the polls i won every debate including the three with crooked hillary clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught this crew looks somewhat easier than crooked but you never know
the economy is the best it has ever been even much of the fake news is giving me credit for that

a very sad time for america when the supreme court of the united states wont allow a question of is this person a citizen of the united states to be asked on the census going on for a long time i have asked the department of commerce and the department of justice
to do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions and this very important case to a successful conclusion usa usa usa
iran was violating the billion dollar plus billion dollar in cash nuclear deal with the united states and others who paid nothing long before i became president and they have now breached their stockpile limit not good
our july th salute to america at the lincoln memorial is looking to be really big it will be the show of a lifetime
we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world we have the greatest military anywhere in the world not bad
sp hits new record high up for the year congratulations
china and europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with usa we should match or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games as they have for many years
the cost of our great salute to america tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth we own the planes we have the pilots the airport is right next door andrews all we need is the fuel we own the tanks and all fireworks are donated by two of the greats nice
congratulations to navy seal eddie gallagher his wonderful wife andrea and his entire family you have been through much together glad i could help
the news reports about the department of commerce dropping its quest to put the citizenship question on the census is incorrect or to state it differently fake we are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question
our border patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses the democrats bad immigration laws which could be easily fixed are the problem great job by border patrol above and beyond many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they
came from and in far safer conditions no matter how good things actually look even if perfect the democrat visitors will act shocked aghast at how terrible things are just pols if they really want to fix them change the immigration laws and loopholes so easy to do
now if you really want to fix the crisis at the southern border both humanitarian and otherwise tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally and hopefully through a system based on merit this way we have no problems at all
if illegal immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers just tell them not to come all problems solved
mexico is doing a far better job than the democrats on the border thank you mexico
iran has just issued a new warning rouhani says that they will enrich uranium to any amount we want if there is no new nuclear deal be careful with the threats iran they can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before

strong jobs report low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the united states knowing that our federal reserve doesnt have a clue they raised rates too soon too often tightened while others did just the opposite
as well as we are doing from the day after the great election when the market shot right up it could have been even better massive additional wealth would have been created used very well our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve
our country is the envy of the world thank you mr president 
democrats must change the loophole asylum laws but they probably wont they want open borders which means massive crime and drugs 
jerry will be getting the presidential medal of freedom well deserved 
great coach great guy 
a wonderful man and great republican 
joe biden is a reclamation project some things are just not salvageable china and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him he deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare added more debt than all other presidents combined wont win
sleepy joe biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyones taxes if he becomes president ridiculously all democrats want to substantially raise taxes
last year was the first in years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially if dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast
congratulations to the us womens soccer team on winning the world cup great and exciting play america is proud of you all
the fake news media in particular the failing is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the border detention centers first of all people should not be entering our country illegally only for us to then have to care for them we should be allowed to focus on 
united states citizens first border patrol and others in law enforcement have been doing a great job we said there was a crisis the fake news the dems said it was manufactured now all agree we were right but they always knew that they are crowded which we
brought up not them because the dems wont change the loopholes and asylum big media con job
we are building the wall now but the reason the badly needed wall wasnt approved in the republican controlled house and senate was that we had a very slim majority in the senate needed democrat votes they were totally unwilling to give wall votes to us want open borders
watching weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings fake news or lyin brian williams remember when he totally fabricated a war story trying to make himself into a hero got fired a very dishonest journalist and the crew of degenerate
comcast nbcmsnbc trump haters who do whatever brian steve tell them to do like cnn nbc is also way down in the ratings but who failed in getting the very boring dem debates is now loading up with democrats even using fake unsourced as
a source of information ask the times what they paid for the boston globe what they sold it for lost billion dollars or their old headquarters building disaster or their unfunded liability is changing fast but they forgot the people who got them there
impossible to believe that has hired the person fired by after they tried to hide the bad facts failed for giving crooked hillary clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable now she is all over fox including shep smith by far
their lowest rated show watch the weekend daytime anchors who are terrible go after her big time thats what they want but it sure is not what the audience wants
a massive crowd that fake news some dems didnt want to report 
thank you ari 
brilliant constitutional lawyer dr john eastman said the special prosecutor mueller should have never been appointed in the first place the entire exercise was fundamentally illegal the witch hunt should never happen to another president of the us again a total scam 
i have been very critical about the way the uk and prime minister theresa may handled brexit what a mess she and her representatives have created i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well
thought of within the us we will no longer deal with him the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with
spoke to kevin mccarthy about the earthquakes in california and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding also spoke to governor all working together
very good numbers on the economy much potential for growth trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation we have been treated very unfairly to put it mildly by other countries for many years but that is changing
the wacky ambassador that the uk foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was
handled i told how to do that deal but she went her own foolish waywas unable to get it done a disaster i dont know the ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool tell him the usa now has the best economy military anywhere in the world by far
and they are both only getting bigger better and strongerthank you mr president
i agree with the president the supreme court got it wrong there should be a question about citizenship on the census ag barr sees a pathway to add the citizenship question steve doocy working hard on something that should be so easy people are fed up
outrage is growing in the great state of minnesota where our patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the pledge of allegiance i will be fighting with you 
with president trump at the helm not only is america getting great again but hes going to make our estuaries our rivers our water everything better the things he is doing and done are just helping america tremendously thank you to bruce hrobak 
food stamp participation hits year low wow 
india has long had a field day putting tariffs on american products no longer acceptable
recent strained decisions by the united states supreme court some so simple as allowing the question are you a citizen of the united states on our very expensive census report or the even more strained decisions allowing the worlds most expensive pathetic
healthcare obamacare to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming election is i have long heard that the appointment of supreme court justices is a presidents most important decision so true
after a wonderful dinner at the last night with the amir of qatar it was my great honor to welcome him to the this afternoon 
democrats are coming after our great kentucky senator mitch mcconnell with someone who compared my election to september th
why would kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in congress the senate majority leader for a freshman senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party we need mitch in the senate to keep america great
a truly great patriotic charitable man bernie marcus the cofounder of home depot who at the age of is coming under attack by the radical left democrats with one of their often used weapons they dont want people to shop at those great stores because he contributed
to your favorite president me these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people deplorables in this country than bad do to them what they do to you fight for bernie marcus and home depot
more and more the radical left is using commerce to hurt their enemy they put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their socalled followers not to do business there they dont care who gets hurt but also dont understand that two can play that game
so now the obama appointed judge on the census case are you a citizen of the united states wont let the justice department use the lawyers that it wants to use could this be a first
the reality is that this was a plot from the very beginning to frame trump twittercomtmynepppm
fbis christopher steele fake story falls apart false intel media contacts were flagged before fisa john solomon the hill 
our company has grown since trump has taken control of the white house the presidency in the sense that we have better opportunities now to do what weve been wanting to do for quite some time and that is to create manufacturing jobs i believe that president trump has
done a great job of reducing crime in the african american community because more african americans are at work today trump is not a racist hes a businessman because hes a great businessman hes pushing for lives to be better michael brown ceo hydromatic tech
the dems witch hunt continues 
iran has long been secretly enriching in total violation of the terrible billion dollar deal made by john kerry and the obama administration remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years sanctions will soon be increased substantially
word just out that i won a big part of the deep state and democrat induced witch hunt unanimous decision in my favor from the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit on the ridiculous emoluments case i dont make money but lose a fortune for the honor of
serving and doing a great job as your president including accepting zero salary
my administration is taking groundbreaking action to bring new hope to millions of americans suffering from kidney disease today i signed an executive order advancing american kidney health

the white house will be hosting a very big and very important social media summit today would i have become president without social media yes probably at its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful rose garden for a news conference on the census and citizenship
the pledge of allegiance to our great country in st louis park minnesota is under siege that is why i am going to win the great state of minnesota in the election people are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful usa
nearly one million more blacks and two million more hispanics are employed than when barrack obama left office and minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the trump presidency unemployment among black women has hovered near for the last six
months the lowest since the wall street journal editorial board a tale of two economies 
robert johnson bet i give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction thats benefiting a large number of americans i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy overall if you look at the us economy and you look at
the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth youve got to give the president an a plus for that thank you robert one of our great business leaders
the fake news media loves the narrative that i didnt use many banks because the banks didnt like me no i didnt use many banks because i didnt dont need their money old fashioned isnt it if i did it would have been very easy for me to get
and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world they wanted my business and so did many others
democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called kids in cages inhumane treatment at the border because the horrible picture used was from the obama years very embarrassing 
now the democrats have asked to see more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum they also want to interview the highly
conflicted and compromised mueller again he said he was done after his last minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report enough already go back to work i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday
will be a big and exciting day at the white house for social media
mexico is doing great at the border but china is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great farmers that they said they would hopefully they will start soon
it seems that the brits and the french and the germans are coming around to the idea that the iranians are up to no good 
dow just hit for first time ever
so happy that i was able to keep sikorsky helicopter in the great state of pennsylvania keep america great
a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period
the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six
years or maybe or just kidding they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public thats why they will all be endorsing me at some point one way or the other could you imagine having sleepy joe biden or alfred e newman
or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas th as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media
today i am directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect the free speech rights of all americans we hope to see more transparency more accountability and more freedom 
to everyone on the gulf coast as you make preparations to protect your homes loved ones from flooding the coming storm it is imperative that you heed the directions of state local officials we are working closely w them please be prepared be careful be safe
i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity
similarly facebook libras virtual currency will have little standing or dependability if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national
and international we have only one real currency in the usa and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world and it will always stay that way it is called the united states dollar
each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation you are challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the american people together you reach more people than any television broadcast by far twittercomiwepoohlgp

paul ryan the failed vp candidate former speaker of the house whose record of achievement was atrocious except during my first two years as president ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his party in the lurch both as a fundraiser leader
when mitt chose paul i told people thats the end of that presidential run he quit congress because he didnt know how to win they gave me standing os in the great state of wisconsin booed him off the stage he promised me the wall failed happening anyway
he had the majority blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing never knew how to go after the dems like they go after us couldnt get him out of congress fast enough
thank you 
interesting 
thank you lara and jessie jane

when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get
companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and fast but very happy with the deal i made
if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency subsidize companies to lessen effect of tariffs so far little effect to consumers companies will relocate to us
great job by rush limbaugh on 
wow ratings have crashed lost all credibility
alex acosta informed me this morning that he felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than years ago was bad for the administration which he so strongly believes in and he graciously tendered his resignation

muellers partisan witch hunt 
andy mccabe is a major sleazebag among many other things he took massive amounts of money from crooked hillary reps for wifes campaign while hillary was under investigation by fbi 
this is one of the most horrible abuses of all those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story illegal deletion by mueller they gave us the insurance policy 
house minority leader kevin mccarthy is a far superior leader than was lame duck speaker paul ryan tougher smarter and a far better fundraiser kevin is already closing in on million dollars pauls final year numbers were according to breitbart abysmal people like
paul ryan almost killed the republican party weak ineffective stupid are not exactly the qualities that republicans or the citizens of our country were looking for right now our spirit is at an all time high far better than the radical left dems youll see next year
 approval rating in the republican party an all time high ronald reagan was thank you
a big risk of major flooding in large parts of louisiana and all across the gulf coast please be very careful
so interesting to see progressive democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all now loudly
and viciously telling the people of the united states the greatest and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run why dont they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came then come back and show us how
it is done these places need your help badly you cant leave fast enough im sure that nancy pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements
thank you so nice but we are getting it done anyway 
fridays tour showed vividly to politicians and the media how well run and clean the childrens detention centers are great reviews failing story was fake the adult single men areas were clean but crowded also loaded up with a big percentage of criminals
sorry cant let them into our country if too crowded tell them not to come to usa and tell the dems to fix the loopholes problem solved
think what it would be without the year witch hunt and fake news media in partnership with the democrats 
so sad to see the democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country and who in addition hate israel with a true and unbridled passion whenever confronted they call their adversaries including nancy pelosi racist their disgusting language
and the many terrible things they say about the united states must not be allowed to go unchallenged if the democrat party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 
we are doing great economically as a country number one despite the feds antiquated policy on rates and tightening much room to grow
chinas nd quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than years the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for nontariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving this is why china wants to make a deal
with the us and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing pumping not by the us taxpayer
when will the radical left congresswomen apologize to our country the people of israel and even to the office of the president for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said so many people are angry at them their horrible disgusting actions
if democrats want to unite around the foul language racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular unrepresentative congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the us
we all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our own country theyre calling the guards along our border the border patrol agents concentration camp guards they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the benjamins
they are antisemitic they are antiamerica we dont need to know anything about them personally talk about their policies i think they are american citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting that the american people will reject
what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country see how that works for controlling immigration they talk about israel like theyre a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region they wanted
to impeach president trump on day one make them the face of the future of the democrat party you will destroy the democrat party their policies will destroy our country need i say more
here we go with the fake polls just like what happened with the election against crooked hillary clinton abc nbc cnn they all got it wrong on purpose suppression polls so early they will never learn
we will never be a socialist or communist country if you are not happy here you can leave it is your choice and your choice alone this is about love for america certain people hate our country
they are antiisrael pro alqaeda and comment on the attack some people did something radical left democrats want open borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more
detention facilities are not concentration camps america has never been stronger than it is now rebuilt military highest stock market ever lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before keep america great
the dems were trying to distance themselves from the four progressives but now they are forced to embrace them that means they are endorsing socialism hate of israel and the usa not good for the democrats
the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws
make america great again
the best economy in our lifetime 
the democrat congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the house or senate yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the democrat party horrible antiisrael antiusa proterrorist public
shouting of the fword among many other terrible things and the petrified dems run for the hills why isnt the house voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said because they are the radical left and the democrats are afraid to take them on sad
billionaire tech investor peter thiel believes google should be investigated for treason he accuses google of working with the chinese government a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone the trump administration will take a look

our country is free beautiful and very successful if you hate our country or if you are not happy here you can leave
those tweets were not racist i dont have a racist bone in my body the socalled vote to be taken is a democrat con game republicans should not show weakness and fall into their trap this should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the democrat
congresswomen who i truly believe based on their actions hate our country get a list of the horrible things they have said omar is polling at cortez at nancy pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the democrat party see you in 
kevin mccarthy the presidents tweets were not racist the controversy over the tweets is all politics i will vote against this resolution thank you kevin

visible members of the house democrats who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate the republican vote was wow also this was the first time since that the speaker of the house was ruled out of order and broke the rules of the house quite a day
in america if you hate our country you are free to leave the simple fact of the matter is the four congresswomen think that america is wicked in its origins they think that america is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil theyre entitled to their
opinion theyre americans now im entitled to my opinion i just think theyre left wing cranks theyre the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle we should ignore them the squad has moved the democrat party substantially left and
they are destroying the democrat party im appalled that so many of our presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse im entitled to say that theyre wack jobs louisiana senator john kennedy

a lot of bad things are happening in puerto rico the governor is under siege the mayor of san juan is a despicable and incompetent person who i wouldnt trust under any circumstance and the united states congress foolishly gave billion dollars for hurricane relief much
of which was squandered away or wasted never to be seen again this is more than twice the amount given to texas florida combined i know the people of puerto rico well and they are great but much of their leadership is corrupt robbing the us government blind

it is amazing how the fake news media became crazed over the chant send her back by a packed arena a record crowd in the great state of north carolina but is totally calm accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by the three radical left congresswomen
mainstream media which has lost all credibility has either officially or unofficially become a part of the radical left democrat party it is a sick partnership so pathetic to watch they even covered a tiny staged crowd as they greeted foul mouthed omar in minnesota a
state which i will win in because they cant stand her and her hatred of our country and they appreciate all that i have done for them opening up mining and much more which has led to the best employment economic year in minnesotas long and beautiful history
thomas the chin friedman a weak and pathetic sort of guy writes columns for the new york times in between rounds of his favorite game golf two weeks ago while speaking to a friend on his cell phone i unfortunately ended up speaking to friedman we spoke for a while and
he could not have been nicer or more respectful to your favorite president me then i saw the column he wrote trump will be reelected wont he he called me a racist which i am not and said rhode island went from economically bad to great in years because the
governor of the state did a good job that may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our country the turnaround that my administration has caused really nasty to me in his average iq columns kissed my a on the call phony
because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower correct
i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second his first statement is correct in that the fed raised far too fast too early also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening we are in a world competition winning big
but it is no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast and so much we would be doing even better than we are doing right now this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the us growth which would greatly reduce debt dont blow it
fed there is almost no inflation
thank you twittercomgtincpwt

presidential harassment
make america great again
i dont believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country they should apologize to america and israel for the horrible hateful things they have said they are destroying the democrat party but are weak insecure people who can never destroy our great nation
congratulations to bibi on becoming the longest serving pm in the history of israel under your leadership israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy

senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators this is a great thing nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally they wildly rushed border patrol some agents were badly injured
based on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous bad for our country the border is it is not a manufactured crisis as the fake news media their democrat partners tried to portray he said he wants to meet i will set up a meeting asap
thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the fake news media will never do twittercomsgrnbshpt
with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete as good
as we have done it could have been soooo much better interest rate costs should have been much lower gdp our countrys wealth accumulation much higher such a waste of time money also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in
it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down very inexpensive in fact productive to move now the fed raised tightened far too much too fast in other words they missed it big dont miss it again
the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news they said advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four congresswomen now really does that sound like me what advisors there were no talking points
except for those stated by me reams of paper were never given to me it is a made up story meant to demean belittle the post had no sources the facts remain the same that we have radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel our country
the mainstream media is out of control they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see it has never been this bad they have gone bonkers no longer care what is right or wrong this large scale false reporting is sick
fake news equals the enemy of the people
highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction
but the questions should be asked why were all of clintons people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested themthis is illegal
the report of iran capturing cia spies is totally false zero truth just more lies and propaganda like their shot down drone put out by a religious regime that is badly failing and has no idea what to do their economy is dead and will get much worse iran is a total mess
going with first lady to pay our respects to justice stevens leaving now

when we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated barrier on the southern border something which cannot do the job the fake news media gives us zero credit for building a new wall we have replaced many miles of old barrier with powerful new walls
i completely read the entire mueller report and do you know what i concluded after reading both volume and volume there is no there there no there there we completely wasted everybodys time and taxpayers money

leaving for turning point usa will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet see you there
i was saddened to learn of the recent passing of bob morgenthau a truly great man bob served as a naval officer in world war ii was an extraordinary us attorney manhattan district attorney and always a warrior for our country that he loved so dearly
i got to know him over his many years as chairman of the police athletic league for which he devoted so much time and energy bob morgenthau a legend will be greatly missed
budget deal gives great victories to our military and vets keeps out democrat poison pill riders republicans and democrats in congress need to act asap and support this deal
just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a never trumper attorney to help robert mueller with his testimony before congress tomorrow what a disgrace to our system never heard of this before very unfair should not be allowed a rigged witch hunt
just watched rep eric swalwell be asked endless softball questions by on about the phony witch hunt he was just forced out of the democrat presidential primary because he polled at zero fox sure aint what it used to be too bad
thank you twittercomeqrimdq
oh well we still have the great who i hear has a really strong show tonight pm
congratulations to our new secretary of defense mark 
the young leaders here today are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation it is a movement about reclaiming your future rebuilding your country restoring your destiny and renewing the values that are the true source of american greatness 
so robert mueller has now asked for his long time never trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers whats this all about his lawyer represented the basement server guy who got off free in the crooked hillary case this should not be allowed rigged witch hunt
so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction wrong why didnt robert mueller investigate the investigators
it was never agreed that robert mueller could use one of his many democrat never trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers this was specifically not agreed to and i would never have agreed to it the greatest witch hunt in us history by far
why didnt robert mueller his band of angry democrats spend any time investigating crooked hillary clinton lyin leakin james comey lisa page and her psycho lover peter s andy mccabe the beautiful ohr family fusion gps and many more including himself andrew w
so why didnt the highly conflicted robert mueller investigate how and why crooked hillary clinton deleted and acid washed emails immediately after getting a subpoena from the united states congress she must have great lawyers
no collusion no obstruction
keep america great
it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesnt say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the
interview including the vice president of the united states
this has been a disaster for the democrats and a disaster for the reputation of robert mueller chris wallace 
mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said no in other words there was no obstruction 
i would like to thank the democrats for holding this mornings hearing now after hours robert mueller has to subject himself to an embarrassment to our country
truth is a force of nature
the kind of questions the white house correspondents were asking is almost like they didnt see what went on at the hearings the hearings were a disaster for robert mueller the democrats nevertheless the fake news media will try to make the best out of it
even michael moore agrees that the dems and mueller blew it 
impeachments over twittercomjixcsnzc
the democrats had nothing 
the democrats lost so big today their party is in shambles right now 
the medias mueller meltdown twittercomexdlkovu

yesterday changed everything it really did clear the president he wins it changed everything in favor of the president who said all along this investigation is rooted in nothing mueller was exposed as being best friends with comey today you say
impeachment you have a party of one its over nancy said jerry please sit down very bad idea we discovered that after putting so much time energy into the mueller report it turns out mueller didnt know what was in his report 
fox poll say best economy in decades

we love our law enforcement officers all around this great country what took place in nyc with water being tossed on nypd officers was a total disgrace it is time for to stand up for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well
what took place was completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated bill de blasio should act immediately
very disappointed in prime minister stefan lfven for being unable to act sweden has let our african american community down in the united states i watched the tapes of aap rocky and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers treat americans fairly 
give aap rocky his freedom we do so much for sweden but it doesnt seem to work the other way around sweden should focus on its real crime problem 
i am pleased to announce the house has passed our budget deal great for our military and our vets a big thank you
intelligence community disappointed mueller didnt investigate the steele dossier and plenty of other things
taken for granted a wonderful new book by gianno caldwell on how conservatism can win back the americans that liberalism failed has my full endorsement
 is at it again so different from what they used to be during the primaries before proud warriors now new fox polls which have always been terrible to me they had me losing big to crooked hillary have me down to sleepy joe even considering
the fact that i have gone through a three year vicious witch hunt perpetrated by the lamestream media in collusion with crooked and the democrat party there can be no way with the greatest economy in us history that i can be losing to the sleepy one keep america great
there may or may not be national security concerns with regard to google and their relationship with china if there is a problem we will find out about it i sincerely hope there is not
q gdp up not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the federal reserve anchor wrapped around our neck almost no inflation usa is set to zoom
apple will not be given tariff waiver or relief for mac pro parts that are made in china make them in the usa no tariffs
france just put a digital tax on our great american technology companies if anybody taxes them it should be their home country the usa we will announce a substantial reciprocal action on macrons foolishness shortly ive always said american wine is better than french wine
great morning at the pentagon yesterday congratulations to our new defense secretary mark 
the wto is broken when the worlds richest countries claim to be developing countries to avoid wto rules and get special treatment no more today i directed the us trade representative to take action so that countries stop cheating the system at the expense of the usa
 puts guatemalan migrants on fast track home 
wow big victory on the wall the united states supreme court overturns lower court injunction allows southern border wall to proceed big win for border security and the rule of law
rep elijah cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous his district is considered the worst in the usa
as proven last week during a congressional tour the border is clean efficient well run just very crowded cumming district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess if he spent more time in baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous filthy place
why is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states no human being would want to live there where is all this money going how much is stolen investigate this corrupt mess immediately
consideration is being given to declaring antifa the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting only nonfighters people over the heads with baseball bats a major organization of terror along with ms others would make it easier for police to do their job
the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen truth is he had no facts on his side nothing he could do
the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again how sick disgusting and bad for our country are they what they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway dems have become the do nothing party
such a big victory of our country supreme court approves trump administration plan to use military funds for the wall we will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries
democrats dont care about border security they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum would be so easy they want open borders which means crimecrimecrime
elijah cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through oversight he does nothing for his very poor very dangerous and very badly run district take a look 
we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report we didnt have to and even mueller himself but now that both were a total bust they say it wasnt good enough nothing will ever be good enough for them witch hunt
no collusion no obstruction total exoneration democrat witch hunt
 why dont you focus on your district 
 your district 
thanks 
thank you 
thank you 
one of the biggest things to come out of muellers testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there anything that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal no misty marris true but many other great exonerating things came out
robert muellers testimony and the mueller report itself was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt it is an embarrassment to the usa that they dont know how to stop they cant help themselves they are totally lost they are clowns
so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore statistically baltimore ranks last in almost every major category cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing
the real collusion the conspiracy the crime was between the clinton campaign the dnc fusion gps christopher steeleand many others including comey mccabe lisa page and her lover ohr and his wonderful wife and on and on 
the democrats are still doing the russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime media credibility is now shot democrat credibility is shot theyve wasted over hearings on a hoax theyve done nothing on infrastructure drug prices trade 
if it werent for donald trump we would never know how corrupt these democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a deep state now we know it 
someone please explain to nancy pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore just take
a look the facts speak far louder than words the democrats always play the race card when in fact they have done so little for our nations great african american people now lowest unemployment in us history and only getting better elijah cummings has failed badly
speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to nancy pelosis district in san francisco it is not even recognizeable lately something must be done before it is too late the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country
elijah cummings has had his chance to address it crime conditions in baltimore for decades and he hasnt gotten it done how can he get it done when he just wants to use his oversight committee to hurt innocent people and divide our country
there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame
if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership his radical oversight is a joke
under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states no president has come close to doing this before i also created successful opportunity zones waiting for nancy and elijah to say thank you mr president
i am pleased to announce that highly respected congressman john ratcliffe of texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence a former us attorney john will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves dan coats the current director will
be leaving office on august th i would like to thank dan for his great service to our country the acting director will be named shortly
if the democrats would have closed the loopholes two years ago when president trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have happened 
the democrats hate this president so much theyre forgetting about their duty to secure our border sad but true
law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended be careful and safe
good luck with the book george should do well 
i have known al for years went to fights with him don king always got along well he loved trump he would ask me for favors often al is a con man a troublemaker always looking for a score just doing his thing must have intimidated comcastnbc hates whites cops 
baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation years of all talk no action so tired of listening to the same old bullnext reverend al will show up to complain protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad
if the democrats are going to defend the radical left squad and king elijahs baltimore fail it will be a long road to the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket
al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events he would say its a personal favor to me seldom but sometimes i would go it was fine he came to my office in tt during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me just a conman at work
the eu and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison too bad
crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe
even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call
the fed raised way too early and way too much their quantitative tightening was another big mistake while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering we are competing with other
countries that know how to play the game against the us thats actually why the eu was formedand for china until now the us has been easy pickens the fed has made all of the wrong moves a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway
looking forward to my meeting at pm with wonderful inner city pastors
it is the th anniversary of a great organization run by people who truly love our country on behalf of all americans i thank them 
the republican party has a new star his name is daniel cameron and he is running for attorney general of the commonwealth of kentucky
he is tough on crime strong on borders and will fight for our second amendment daniel will never let you down he has my full and complete endorsement
just remember the iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation
senator cindy hydesmith is doing a great job for the people of mississippi and fully supports our agenda cindy is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration
she loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment cindy has my full and total endorsement 
elijah cummings never even went to the southern border and then he screams at the very good people who despite congresses failure to fix the loopholes and asylum make it work crossings are way down and the wall is being built even with zero dem help border getting strong
baltimores numbers are the worst in the united states on crime and the economy billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail the money was stolen or wasted ask elijah cummings where it went he should investigate himself with his oversight committee
i dont know what its going to take a lot of democratic run cities all over america look like this its not just baltimore unfortunately kimberly klacik baltimore journalist remember vote for trump what the h do you have to lose best unemployment numbers
somali refugees arresed in tucson on way to egypt they were in touch with an agent posing as a terrorist one of them stated the best wake up call is islamic state to get victory or another get smart people 
despite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders refusing to change the loopholes asylum tremendous progress is being made the the southern border we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration lawsthey didnt
china is doing very badly worst year in was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now no signs that they are doing so that is the problem with china they just dont come through our economy has become much larger than the chinese economy is last years
my team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit they should probably wait out our election to see if we get one of the democrat stiffs like sleepy joe then they could make a great deal like in past years and continue
to ripoff the usa even bigger and better than ever before the problem with them waiting however is that if when i win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating nowor no deal at all we have all the cards our past leaders never got it
wow morning joe psycho ratings have really crashed very small audience people are tired of hearing fake news delivered with an anger that is not to be believed sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected thanks was on all the time lost all of its juice

wow a federal judge in the southern district of ny completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the democratic national committee against our historic campaign for president the judge said the dnc case was entirely divorced from the facts yet another total complete
vindication exoneration from the russian wikileaks and every other form of hoax perpetrated by the dnc radical democrats and others this is really big stuff especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by president clinton the witch hunt ends
such a great victory in court yesterday on the russian hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our country treason hopefully the attorney generel of the united states and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened never again
if i hadnt won the election we would be in a great recessiondepression right now the people i saw on stage last night you can add in sleepy joe harris the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before with me only up

cnns don lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate question that i was a racist when in fact i am the least racist person in the world perhaps someone should explain to don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased fair
or is he too dumb stupid to understand that no wonder cnns ratings msnbcs also have gone down the tubes and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom dont hold your breath
the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect
to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards
i am very happy for eddie gallagher and his family
what the market wanted to hear from jay powell and the federal reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive ratecutting cycle which would keep pace with china the european union and other countries around the world
as usual powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldnt have started in the first place no inflation we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve
the get a bigger raise 
the radical left dems went after me for using the words druginfested concerning baltimore take a look at elijah c 
thank you bill say hello to our great veterans 
very low ratings for the democratic debate last night theyre desperate for trump
experts stated that the fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake james bullard of st louis fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last december mistake powell cut rate and then he started talking 
the cages for kids were built by the obama administration in he had the policy of child separation i ended it even as i realized that more families would then come to the border 
the people on the stage tonight and last were not those that will either make america great again or keep america great our country now is breaking records in almost every category from stock market to military to unemployment we have prosperity success like never before
it will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success or let it go we are respected again all around the world keep it that way i said i will never let you down and i havent we will only grow bigger better and stronger together

our representatives have just returned from china where they had constructive talks having to do with a future trade deal we thought we had a deal with china three months ago but sadly china decided to renegotiate the deal prior to signing more recently china agreed to
buy agricultural product from the us in large quantities but did not do so additionally my friend president xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the united states this never happened and many americans continue to die trade talks are continuing and
during the talks the us will start on september st putting a small additional tariff of on the remaining billion dollars of goods and products coming from china into our country this does not include the billion dollars already tariffed at 
we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with china on a comprehensive trade deal and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one

really bad news the baltimore house of elijah cummings was robbed too bad
kim jong un and north korea tested short range missiles over the last number of days these missiles tests are not a violation of our signed singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands there may be a united nations violation but
chairman kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for north korea to gain the potential as a country under kim jong uns leadership is unlimited also there is far too much to lose i may be wrong but i believe that
chariman kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the united states with me as president can make that vision come true he will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to and he does not want to disappoint his friend president trump
aap rocky released from prison and on his way home to the united states from sweden it was a rocky week get home asap aap
our great republican congressman john ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the lamestream media rather than going through months of slander and libel i explained to john how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people
john has therefore decided to stay in congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of texas and our country i will be announcing my nomination for dni shortly
nice to see that one of my best pupils is still a giant trump fan steve joined me after i won the primaries but i loved working with him 
a great couple 
great working with you john a big win for our amazing ranchers 
countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate real trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations they dont want to be targeted for tariffs by the us
things are going along very well with china they are paying us tens of billions of dollars made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going so far our consumer is paying nothing and no inflation no help from fed
terrible shootings in elpaso texas reports are very bad many killed working with state and local authorities and law enforcement spoke to governor to pledge total support of federal government god be with you all
fight hard tonight colby you are a real champ 
pastor scott a great guy and tough 
'god be with you all' trump pledges full support for el paso shooting victims as lawmakers also grieve via 
todays shooting in el paso texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice i know that i stand with everyone in this country to condemn todays hateful act there are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people
melania and i send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of texas
the fbi local and state law enforcement are working together in el paso and in dayton ohio information is rapidly being accumulated in dayton much has already be learned in el paso law enforcement was very rapid in both instances updates will be given throughout the day
god bless the people of el paso texas god bless the people of dayton ohio
today i authorized the lowering of the flags to halfstaff at all federal government buildings in honor of the victims of the tragedies in el paso texas and dayton ohio
the flags at the white house will be lowered today through thursday august melania and i are praying for all those impacted by this unspeakable act of evil
we cannot let those killed in el paso texas and dayton ohio die in vain likewise for those so seriously wounded we can never forget them and those many who came before them republicans and democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying
this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform we must have something good if not great come out of these two tragic events
the media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our country fake news has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years news coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse
china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low its called currency manipulation are you listening federal reserve this is a major violation which will greatly weaken china over time
based on the historic currency manipulation by china it is now even more obvious to everyone that americans are not paying for the tariffs they are being paid for compliments of china and the us is taking in tens of billions of dollars china has always
used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories hurt our jobs depress our workers wages and harm our farmers prices not anymore
china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the us with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation so onesided it should have been stopped many years ago
the first lady and i join all americans in praying and grieving for the victims their families and the survivors we will stand by their side forever 
today i am also directing the department of justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly decisively and without years of needless delay 
we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people open wounds cannot heal if we are divided we must seek real bipartisan solutions that will truly make america safer and better for all 
thank you and tom homan 
check out what is up to for the election twittercomromwnmusp

did george bush ever condemn president obama after sandy hook president obama had mass shootings during his reign not many people said obama is out of control mass shootings were happening before the president even thought about running for pres 
its political season and the election is around the corner they want to continue to push that racist narrative and i am the least racist person black hispanic and asian unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states
massive amounts of money from china and other parts of the world is pouring into the united states for reasons of safety investment and interest rates we are in a very strong position companies are also coming to the us in big numbers a beautiful thing to watch
as they have learned in the last two years our great american farmers know that china will not be able to hurt them in that their president has stood with them and done what no other president would do and ill do it again next year if necessary
thank you mr wonderful i like you too twittercomnqctvsp

 of google was in the oval office working very hard to explain how much he liked me what a great job the administration is doing that google was not involved with chinas military that they didnt help crooked hillary over me in the election that they
 are not planning to illegally subvert the election despite all that has been said to the contrary it all sounded good until i watched kevin cernekee a google engineer say terrible things about what they did in and that they want to make sure that trump losses
in lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary clinton and boosted negative stories on donald trump all very illegal we are watching google very closely
will be going to dayton ohio and el paso texas tomorrow to meet with first responders law enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings
california is trying to meddle with a ballot in order to oppose president trump and its clearly something california is not allowed to do it violates the right of the republican party or any party to choose its leaders under the free speech clause and under the th
amendment john yoo former governor jerry brown vetoed the same bill in that it was ridiculous and totally unconstitutional just more of the record setting presidential harassment dont feel badly new york state is far worse
beto phony name to indicate hispanic heritage orourke who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of texas where i trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at in the democrat primary should respect the victims law enforcement be quiet
south korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the united states in order to defend itself from north korea over the past many decades the us has been paid very little by south korea but last year at the request of president trump south korea paid 
talks have begun to further increase payments to the united states south korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the united states of america the relationship between the two countries is a very good one
trump urges unity vs racism was the correct description in the first headline by the failing new york times but it was quickly changed to assailing hate but not guns after the radical left democrats went absolutely crazy fake news thats what were up against
this is an astounding development in journalism ive never seen it happen before ive just never seen anything like this is that journalism today i dont think so mark penn former clinton advisor after years i almost got a good headline from the times
meanwhile the dayton ohio shooter had a history of supporting political figures like bernie sanders elizabeth warren and antifa i hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to fake news thank you
three more central banks cut rates our problem is not china we are stronger than ever money is pouring into the us while china is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege our problem is a federal reserve that is too
proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much and that i was right they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation incompetence is a
terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily we will win anyway but it would be much easier if the fed understood which they dont that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense
today we honor all of our countrys purple heart recipients their loved ones and our gold star families for their immeasurable sacrifice these american patriots represent the unyielding and unmatched strength and determination of the us armed forces 
watching sleepy joe biden making a speech sooo boring the lamestream media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy it will be over for them not to mention the fact that our country will do poorly with him it will be one big crash but at least china will be happy
just left dayton ohio where i met with the victims families law enforcement medical staff first responders it was a warm wonderful visit tremendous enthusiasm even love then i saw failed presidential candidate sherrod brown mayor whaley totally
misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital their news conference after i left for el paso was a fraud it bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that i was so lucky to meet and spend time with they were all amazingo
watching fake news cnn is better than watching shepard smith the lowest rated show on actually whenever possible i turn to 
we love you dayton ohio 
the people i met today in dayton are the finest anywhere 
i dont know who joaquin castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much keep fighting joaquin
leaving el paso for the white house what great people i met there and in dayton ohio the fake news worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didnt work the love respect enthusiasm were there for all to see they have been through so much sad
the dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts racism they are truly disgusting they even used it on nancy pelosi i will be putting out a list of all people who have been so ridiculously accused
incredible afternoon in el paso texas we love you and are with you all the way 
my time spent in dayton and el paso with some of the greatest people on earth thank you for a job well done 
just watched a world class loser tim obrien who i havent seen or spoken to in many years knows nothing about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me years ago fired like a dog from other jobs saw him on lyin brian williams trump slam show bad tv
i am so amazed that msnbc cnn can keep putting on over and over again people that have no idea what i am all about and yet they speak as experts on trump same people since long before the election and how did that work out for the haters and losers not well
as your president one would think that i would be thrilled with our very strong dollar i am not the feds high interest rate level in comparison to other countries is keeping the dollar high making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like caterpillar boeing
john deere our car companies others to compete on a level playing field with substantial fed cuts there is no inflation and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition we have the greatest companies
in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our federal reserve they have called it wrong at every step of the way and we are still winning can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right
iran is in serious financial trouble they want desperately to talk to the us but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us including president macron of france
i know emmanuel means well as do all others but nobody speaks for the united states but the united states itself no one is authorized in any way shape or form to represent us
sue gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career i have gotten to know sue over the past years and have developed great respect for her sue has announced she will be leaving on august which
coincides with the retirement of dan coats a new acting director of national intelligence will be named shortly
i am pleased to inform you that the honorable joseph maguire current director of the national counterterrorism center will be named acting director of national intelligence effective august th admiral maguire has a long and distinguished
career in the military retiring from the us navy in he commanded at every level including the naval special warfare command he has also served as a national security fellow at harvard university i have no doubt he will do a great job
rod blagojevich the former governor of illinois was sentenced to years in prison he has served years many people have asked that i study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one white house staff is continuing the review of this matter
serious discussions are taking place between house and senate leadership on meaningful background checks i have also been speaking to the nra and others so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected guns should not be placed in the hands of
mentally ill or deranged people i am the biggest second amendment person there is but we all must work together for the good and safety of our country common sense things can be done that are good for everyone
liberal hollywood is racist at the highest level and with great anger and hate they like to call themselves elite but they are not elite in fact it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the elite the movie coming out is made in order
to inflame and cause chaos they create their own violence and then try to blame others they are the true racists and are very bad for our country
maggie haberman of the failing reported that i was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in dayton el paso when in fact i was the one who stated very strongly that i didnt want the fake news inside told my people not to let them in fake reporting
in a letter to me sent by kim jong un he stated very nicely that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint ussouth korea joint exercise are over it was a long letter much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises it was
also a small apology for testing the short range missiles and that this testing would stop when the exercises end i look forward to seeing kim jong un in the not too distant future a nuclear free north korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world
never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt we are not fighting the democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged lamestream media they have gone totally crazy make america great again
got to see by accident wacko comedian bill mahers show so many lies he said patients in el paso hospital didnt want to meet with me wrong had really great meetings with numerous patients said i was on vacation wrong long planned fix up of wh stay here rather than
cause big disruption by going to manhattan working almost all of the time including evenings dont have to be in wh to do thatand sooo many other false statements he is right about one thing though i will win again in otherwise he pays in taxes
china wants to make a deal so badly thousands of companies are leaving because of the tariffs they must stem the flow at the same time china may be hoping for a democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of america the theft of hundreds of billions of s
think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the fake news media really is it may be the most corrupt and disgusting business almost there is make america great again
joe biden just said we believe in facts not truth does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president we are playing in a very big and complicated world joe doesnt have a clue
anthony scaramucci who was quickly terminated days from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on president trump like many other socalled television experts he knows very little about me
other than the fact that this administration has probably done more than any other administration in its first years of existence anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on tv and its not for being the mooch
so funny to watch little donny deutsch on tv with his own failing show when i did the apprentice donny would call me along with others and beg to be on that very successful show he had the tv bug i would let him come on though he erin had very little
tv talent then during the election i would watch as joe scarborough his very angry psycho wife would push donny to the point of total humiliation he would never fight back because he wanted to stay on tv even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition
many incredible things are happening right now for our country after years of being ripped off by other nations on both trade deals and the military things are changing fast big progress is being made america is respected again keep america great
thank you negop 
scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my election victory is only upset that i didnt want him back in the administration where he desperately wanted to be also i seldom had time to return his many calls to me he just wanted to be on tv
two great and loyal friends 
the united states is learning much from the failed missile explosion in russia we have similar though more advanced technology the russian skyfall explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond not good
curt schilling a great pitcher and patriot is considering a run for congress in arizona terrific 
thank you john you are a special guy 
i thought chris was fredo also the truth hurts totally lost it low ratings 
through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system the tens of billions of dollars that the us is receiving is a gift from china prices not up no inflation farmers getting more than china would be spending fake news wont report
thank you steve 
would chris cuomo be given a red flag for his recent rant filthy language and a total loss of control he shouldnt be allowed to have any weapon hes nuts
as usual china said they were going to be buying big from our great american farmers so far they have not done what they said maybe this will be different
all the news thats not fit to print the new york times is no longer the paper we grew up with it is no longer a news organization it is now an agenda driven organization out to change the country for the worse michael goodwin highly respected new york post columnist
many are blaming me and the united states for the problems going on in hong kong i cant imagine why
our intelligence has informed us that the chinese government is moving troops to the border with hong kong everyone should be calm and safe
just landed in pennsylvania looking forward to making a speech on energy so important
put it back up we are living with a rigged fake media 
so terrible 
just leaving incredible complex jobs jobs jobs 
see you in new hampshire 
it always happens when a conservative does even a fraction of what chris cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving cursing they get destroyed by the fake news but when a liberal democrat like chris cuomo does it republicans immediately come to his defense we never learn
thank you bill 
no debate on election security should go forward without first agreeing that voter id identification must play a very strong part in any final agreement without voter id it is all so meaningless
great day in the incredible commonwealth of pennsylvania today with the amazing energy workers construction workers and craft workers who make america run and who make america proud no one in the world does it better than you 
great interview of ron vitiello former acting ice director by on about all of the work that is being has been done on our southern border thanks ron terrific job now if only the democrats would fix the loopholes asylum
a fighter and champion great 
join me tomorrow night in manchester new hampshire at pm eastern 
the fed has got to do something the fed is the central bank of the united states not the central bank of the world mark grant correct the federal reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late too bad so much to gain on the upside
so far youve had tariffs imposed on billion dollars worth of chinese products but you cant tell me that it has hurt our economy it really hasnt led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level and we are taking in billions
tremendous amounts of money pouring into the united states people want safety
the great charles payne correctly stated that fed chair jay powell made two enormous mistakes when he said mid cycle adjustment were data dependent he did not do the right thing i agree to put it mildly 
we are winning big time against china companies jobs are fleeing prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down china is not our problem though hong kong is not helping our problem is with the fed raised too much too fast now too slow to cut
spread is way too much as other countries say thank you to clueless jay powell and the federal reserve germany and many others are playing the game crazy inverted yield curve we should easily be reaping big rewards gains but the fed is holding us back we will win
unlike others our economy is strong 
sad 
good things were stated on the call with china the other day they are eating the tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and pouring money into their system the american consumer is fine with or without the september date but much good will come from the short
deferral to december it actually helps china more than us but will be reciprocated millions of jobs are being lost in china to other nontariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving of course china wants to make a deal let them work humanely with hong kong first
i know president xi of china very well he is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people he is also a good man in a tough business i have zero doubt that if president xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the hong kong problem he can do it personal meeting
two great entertainers and more importantly great people check out their show 
go out and get andrew mccarthys new book ball of collusion supervision became the investigator and when they pushed the envelope there was nobody there to tell them no it goes right to the president obama plenty of information that obama was informed knew exactly
what they were doing theres plenty of indication we dont have to speculate holy cow got to read this book wow a very serious situation can never be allowed to happen again drain the swamp
the philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets he had a long and very dangerous criminal record looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police long sentence must get much tougher on street crime
it would show great weakness if israel allowed rep omar and reptlaib to visit they hate israel all jewish people there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds minnesota and michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office they are a disgrace
if president xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the hong kong problem i have no doubt 
the united states is now by far the biggest strongest and most powerful economy in the world it is not even close as others falter we will only get stronger consumers are in the best shape ever plenty of cash business optimism is at an all time high
our great farmers know how important it is to win on trade they will be the big winners
wow the deputy editor of the failing new york times was just demoted should have been fired totally biased and inaccurate reporting the paper is a fraud zero credibility fake news takes another hit but this time a big one
representatives omar and tlaib are the face of the democrat party and they hate israel
the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my reelection the problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on trade and everyone knows that including china
biden doesnt have a clue i will solve the china problem 
andrew thank you we will never forgive or forget 
sadly much truth to this 
if they dont get this trade deal with the us done china could have it first recession or worse in years theres disinvestment in china right now also the fed is too tight i agree steve moore heritage foundation
walmart a great indicator as to how the us is doing just released outstanding numbers our country unlike others is doing great dont let the fake news convince you otherwise
thank you new hampshire keep america great twittercomfbuyysyyi
great news tonight we broke the alltime attendance record previously held by elton john at in manchester new hampshire 
thank you rudy 
a great evening with incredible people in new hampshire 
thank you to my good friend chuck canterbury for years of service to the fraternal order of police and our great men and women in blue you are an incredible patriot
congratulations to patrick yoes for his election as national president of the great fraternal order of police together we will fight for our incredible law enforcement officers
senator jim risch of the great state of idaho has been an incredible supporter of our agenda he is tough on crime strong on borders and will continue to fight for our second amendment jim will never let you down he has my full and complete endorsement
israel was very respectful nice to rep rashida tlaib allowing her permission to visit her grandmother as soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded loudly proclaimed she would not visit israel could this possibly have been a setup israel acted appropriately
rep tlaib wrote a letter to israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother permission was quickly granted whereupon tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup the only real winner here is tlaibs grandmother she doesnt have to see her now
like it or not tlaib and omar are fast becoming the face of the democrat party cortez aoc is fuming not happy about this
i donate of my presidents salary back to our country and feel very good about it 
just completed a very good meeting on afghanistan many on the opposite side of this year war and us are looking to make a deal if possible
having dinner tonight with tim cook of apple they will be spending vast sums of money in the us great
great time in new hampshire last night placed was maxed out totally packed with thousands coming to the arena floor at start thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code energy was really great to see we will win new hampshire in 
look at the tremendous overflow at packed arena in new hampshire last night sorry we couldnt get you in will be back soon 
biggest crowd ever according to arena people thousands outside trying to get in place was packed radical left dems their partner lamestream media saying arena empty check out pictures fake news the enemy of the people 
major consideration is being given to naming antifa an organization of terror portland is being watched very closely hopefully the mayor will be able to properly do his job
thank you to a great and legitimate reporter as opposed to those at the failing new york times 
the fake news media hates to see this 
thank you 
such a disgrace at the once great 
the failing new york times in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history got caught by a leaker that they are shifting from their phony russian collusion narrative the mueller report his testimony were a total disaster to a racism witch hunt
journalism has reached a new low in the history of our country it is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the democrat party the reporting is so false biased and evil that it has now become a very sick jokebut the public is aware 
with all that this administration has accomplished think what my poll numbers would be if we had an honest media which we do not
make america great again
doing really well 
we are doing very well with china and talking
juan williams at is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the fox building lobby he couldnt have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family yet he is always nasty and wrong
our economy is the best in the world by far lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories poised for big growth after trade deals are completed import prices down china eating tariffs helping targeted farmers from big tariff money coming in great future for usa
house democrats want to take action against israel because it is fighting back against two maybe four people that have said unthinkably bad things about it the israeli people dems have such disdain for israel what happened aoc plus is the new face of the democrat party
thank you i couldnt agree more 
the new york times will be out of business soon after i leave office hopefully in years they have zero credibility and are losing a fortune even now especially after their massive unfunded liability im fairly certain theyll endorse me just to keep it all going
great cohesion inside the republican party the best i have ever seen despite all of the fake news my poll numbers are great new internal polls show them to be the strongest weve had so far think what theyd be if i got fair media coverage
anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable nut job who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign i barely knew him until his days of gross incompetencemade a fool of himself bad on tv abused staff
got fired wrote a very nice book about me just recently now the book is a lie said his wife was driving him crazy something big was happening with her getting divorced he was a mental wreck we didnt want him around now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy
democrats want open borders and crime so dangerous for our country but we are building a big beautiful new wall i will protect america the dems dont know where to start 
our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed but the democrats are trying to will the economy to be bad for purposes of the election very selfish our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world
the fed rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well if that happened our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhancedgood for everyone
wow report just out google manipulated from million to million votes for hillary clinton in election this was put out by a clinton supporter not a trump supporter google should be sued my victory was even bigger than thought 
massive overflow crowds in new hampshire last week couldnt get into packed snhu arena fake and corrupt news would like you to believe otherwise make america great again 
thank you twittercomhfkxxbra
spoke to my two good friends prime minister modi of india and prime minister khan of pakistan regarding trade strategic partnerships and most importantly for india and pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in kashmir a tough situation but good conversations
great discussion with prime minister today we talked about brexit and how we can move rapidly on a usuk free trade deal i look forward to meeting with boris this weekend at the in france
thank you to my great supporters at the

nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me he only lasted days 
thank you jon working hard

the fake and corrupt media is sooo bad for our country the enemy of the people 
two incredible people i cant believe theyre not working few work harder 
thank you mike 
maria despite all of their will and energy it wont work 
ratings are way down lost all credibility beautiful to watch 
just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence 
the lamestream media is far beyond fake news they are treading in very dangerous territory 
sorry i dont buy rep tlaibs tears i have watched her violence craziness and most importantly words for far too long now tears she hates israel and all jewish people she is an antisemite she and her friends are the new face of the democrat party live with it
congratulations and on the birth of carolina dorothy trump so proud 
denmark is a very special country with incredible people but based on prime minister mette frederiksens comments that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of greenland i will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time
the prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the united states and denmark by being so direct i thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future
thank you to wayne allyn root for the very nice words president trump is the greatest president for jews and for israel in the history of the world not just america he is the best president for israel in the history of the worldand the jewish people in israel love him
like hes the king of israel they love him like he is the second coming of godbut american jews dont know him or like him they dont even know what theyre doing or saying anymore it makes no sense but thats ok if he keeps doing what hes doing hes good for
all jews blacks gays everyone and importantly hes good for everyone in america who wants a job wow 
brandon judd president national border patrol council this will effectively end catch and release and curb illegal entries
rep tlaib wants to cut off aid to israel this is the new face the of democrat party read the aoc plus statements on their hatred of jews and israel check out rep omar the great people of minnesota wont stand for this
the speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve so true
the fake news lamestream media is doing everything possible the create a us recession even though the numbers facts are working totally in the opposite direction they would be willing to hurt many people but that doesnt matter to them our economy is sooo strong sorry
doing great with china and other trade deals the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed hes like a golfer who cant putt has no touch big us growth if he does the right thing big cut but dont count on him so far he has called it wrong and only let us down
we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them yesterday highest dollar in ushistory no inflation wake up federal reserve such growth potential almost like never before
my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than while at the same time making the cars substantially safer engines would run smoother very little impact on the environment foolish executives
so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the us a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped i hope quantitative tightening strongest dollar in history very tough on exports no inflation
where is the federal reserve
on my way to the great commonwealth of kentucky to deliver remarks at the th annual national convention look forward to being with all of my friends 
for the record denmark is only at of gdp for nato spending they are a wealthy country and should be at we protect europe and yet only of the nato countries are at the mark the united states is at a much much higher level than that
because of me these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided sorry
 very unfair to the united states 
tax cuts deregulation and an administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the us economy to flourish the resulting surge in job creation and record low unemployment has put the american worker in the drivers seat 
the legendary henry ford and alfred p sloan the founders of ford motor company and general motors are rolling over at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost more to consumers crazy
henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modernday descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesnt work as well because execs dont want to fight california regulators car companies should know
that when this administrations alternative is no longer available california will squeeze them to a point of business ruin only reason california is now talking to them is because the feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers
great interviewed on tonight at pm 
it was my honor to sign a presidential memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for k of our most severely disabled veterans with todays order we express the everlasting love loyalty of a truly grateful nation god bless our vets god bless america 
thank you 
germany sells year bonds offering negative yields germany competes with the usa our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do they put us at a disadvantage against our competition strong dollar no inflation they move like quicksand fight or go home
the economy is doing really well the federal reserve can easily make it record setting the question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries be early for a change not late let america win big rather than just win
just heard that sean spicer will be on dancing with the stars he will do great a terrific person who loves our country dearly
just concluded a very good meeting on preventing mass shootings talks are ongoing w both republicans democrats we are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners survivors grieving family members law enforcement the nra mental health professionals and school officials
i am hopeful congress will engage with my team to pass meaningful legislation that will make a real difference and most importantly save lives
check out a fantastic new book still winning why america went all in on donald trumpand why we must do it again by the great writer an excellent read thank you
looking forward to soon being in north carolina to hold a big rally for wonderful dan bishop who is running for congress his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities and socialism he likes the squad more than north carolina dan has my full and complete endorsement
congratulations to the great bob cousy

happy birthday james 
 approval rating within the republican party thank you
the economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well despite this the fake news media together with their partner the democrat party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a recession they are
willing to lose their wealth or a big part of it just for the possibility of winning the election but it wont work because i always find a way to win especially for the people the greatest political movement in the history of our country will have another big win in 
this despite the fake news and polls 
now the fed can show their stuff
as usual the fed did nothing it is incredible that they can speak without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed i will work brilliantly with both and the us will do great
my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powell or chairman xi
our country has lost stupidly trillions of dollars with china over many years they have stolen our intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year they want to continue i wont let that happen we dont need china and frankly would be far
better off without them the vast amounts of money made and stolen by china from the united states year after year for decades will and must stop our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing
your companies home and making your products in the usa i will be responding to chinas tariffs this afternoon this is a great opportunity for the united states also i am ordering all carriers including fed ex amazon ups and the post office to search for refuse
all deliveries of fentanyl from china or anywhere else fentanyl kills americans a year president xi said this would stop it didnt our economy because of our gains in the last years is much larger than that of china we will keep it that way
the dow is down points perhaps on the news that representative seth moulton whoever that may be has dropped out of the presidential race
for many years china and many other countries has been taking advantage of the united states on trade intellectual property theft and much more our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china with no end in sight
sadly past administrations have allowed china to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the american taxpayer as president i can no longer allow this to happen in the spirit of achieving fair trade we must balance this very
unfair trading relationship china should not have put new tariffs on billion dollars of united states product politically motivated starting on october st the billion dollars of goods and products from china currently being taxed at will be taxed at 
additionally the remaining billion dollars of goods and products from china that was being taxed from september st at will now be taxed at thank you for your attention to this matter
just spoke with president of brazil our future trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before i told him if the united states can help with the amazon rainforest fires we stand ready to assist
thank you to for the really nice words and thoughts on tonight hosted by lous friend great job by all ps check out these two great women on tour tomorrow night in nyc at the marriott marquis hotel broadway have fun

disgraceful 
other good polls also in fifties despite only fake news and then phony polls by ap cnn nbc and as always fox who were way off on election 
such a sad and pathetic fall for and jeff z 
for all of the fake news reporters that dont have a clue as to what the law is relative to presidential powers china etc try looking at the emergency economic powers act of case closed
when i looked up to the sky and jokingly said i am the chosen one at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on trade with china little did i realize that the media would claim that i had a messiah complex they knew i was kidding being sarcastic and just
having fun i was smiling as i looked up and around the many reporters with me were smiling also they knew the truthand yet when i saw the reporting cnn msnbc and other fake news outlets covered it as serious news me thinking of myself as the messiah no more trust
face it you probably got a tax cut this was a new york times headline and it is very true if republicans take back the house and keep the senate and presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income tax cut democrats only want to raise your taxes
just had lunch with french president many good things are happening for both of our countries big weekend with other world leaders
looking forward to helping new york city and governor complete the long anticipated and partially built second avenue subway would be extended to east th street in harlem long in the making they now have the team that can get it done
north carolina governor cooper vetoed a bill that would have required sheriffs to cooperate with ice this is a terrible decision for the great people of north carolina he should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime
our great economy is the talk of everyone
france and president have done a really great job thus far with a very important g lunch with emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well progress being made

great meeting this morning with president of egypt at the htel du palais in biarritz france twittercomzlmcgqtpdr
the story by axios that president trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous i never said this just more fake news
great respect for the fact that president xi his representatives want calm resolution so impressed that they are willing to come out state the facts so accurately this is why he is a great leader representing a great country talks are continuing 
very productive meeting with angela merkel the chancellor of the federal republic of germany at the in biarritz france 
just wrapped up a great meeting with my friend prime minister of india at the in biarritz france 
thank you france twittercomahactdey
i agree 
thank you mark 
just returned to washington from france and the very successful g only to find that the fake news is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that i wanted to use nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore this is so ridiculous never happened
i have gotten to know president well in our dealings with brazil he is working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil not easy he and his country have the full and complete support of the usa
starting to look good for the highly respected prime minister of the italian republic giuseppe conte represented italy powerfully at the g loves his country greatly works well with the usa a very talented man who will hopefully remain prime minister
no bedbugs at doral the radical left democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located for the next g doral national miami was under consideration for the next g spread that false and nasty rumor not nice
the g was a great success for the usa and all lamestream media coverage bore no relationship to what actually happened in france fake news it was great
wow yet another big storm heading to puerto rico will it ever end congress approved billion dollars for puerto rico last year an all time record of its kind for anywhere
 confirmed 
the federal reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old usa our fed has been calling it wrong for too long
 pirro is following up her best seller with another book that is destined to also be radicals resistance and revenge the left's plot to remake america out today go get it
looking forward to being with dan bishop in two weeks in north carolina his opponent believes in open borders and sanctuary cities and wont protect your second amendment 
the g in france was so successful and yet when i came back and read the corrupt and fake news and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the great g event
it is amazing that i can be at with zogby when the fake corrupt news is almost against me great job mr president
they do stories so big on elizabeth pocahontas warrens crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all fake news
axios whatever that is sat back and said geeeee lets see what can we make up today to embarrass the president then they said why dont we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it the media in our country is totally out of control
can you believe it im at approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me one is mr appalachian trail who was actually in argentina for bad reasons
another is a onetime bad congressman from illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide then failed in radio the third is a man who couldnt stand up straight while receiving an award i should be able to take them
a made up radical left story about doral bedbugs but bret stephens is loaded up with them been calling me wrong for years along with the few remaining never trumpers all losers 
the infestation of bedbugs at the new york times office was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist bret stephens a conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do he is now quitting twitter after being called a bedbug tough guy
so interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice i am getting on china from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably in fact they got taken to the cleaners we are doing very well with china this has never happened to them before
we are tracking closely tropical storm dorian as it heads as usual to puerto rico fema and all others are ready and will do a great job when they do let them know it and give them a big thank you not like last time that includes from the incompetent mayor of san juan
would be very hard for jeremy corbyn the leader of britains labour party to seek a noconfidence vote against new prime minister boris johnson especially in light of the fact that boris is exactly what the uk has been looking for will prove to be a great one love uk
just watched heavily promoting the democrats through their dnc communications director spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor terrible considering that fox couldnt even land a debate the dems give them nothing 
are all in for the open border socialists or beyond fox hires give hillary the questions juan williams and low ratings shep smith hopeless clueless they should go all the way left and i will still find a way to win thats what i do win too bad
i dont want to win for myself i only want to win for the people the new is letting millions of great people down we have to start looking for a new news outlet fox isnt working for us anymore
our federal reserve cannot mentally keep up with the competition other countries at the g in france all of the other leaders were giddy about how low their interest costs have gone germany is actually getting paid to borrow money zero interest plus no clue fed
puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth their political system is broken and their politicians are either incompetent or corrupt congress approved billions of dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to crooked pols no good
and by the way im the best thing thats ever happened to puerto rico
the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and elsewhere 
another totally fake story in the amazon washington post lobbyist which states that if my aides broke the law to build the wall which is going up rapidly i would give them a pardon this was made up by the washington post only in order to demean and disparage fake news
thank you for the support as we make america great again 
a sad day for the democrats kirsten gillibrand has dropped out of the presidential primary im glad they never found out that she was the one i was really afraid of
the amazon washington post and just did a fake interview on pardons for aids on the wall and that i didnt think the wall on the southern border was that important to stop illegals wanting to come into our country wrong vitally important will make a big impact so bad
there has never been a time in the history of our country that the media was so fraudulent fake or corrupt when the age of trump is looked back on many years from now i only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the fake news
puerto rico is in great shape with hurricane dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated thank you to fema first responders and all for working so hard being so well prepared a great result the bad news florida get ready storm is building and will be big
hurricane dorian looks like it will be hitting florida late sunday night be prepared and please follow state and federal instructions it will be a very big hurricane perhaps one of the biggest
crazy lawrence odonnell who has been calling me wrong from even before i announced my run for the presidency even being previously forced by nbc to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me the apprentice was again forced to apologize this time
for the most ridiculous claim of all that russia russia russia or russian oligarchs cosigned loan documents for me a guarantee totally false as is virtually everything else he and much of the rest of the lamestream media has said about me for years all apologize
the totally inaccurate reporting by lawrence odonnell for which he has been forced by nbc to apologize is no different than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent fake news that i and many millions of great supporters have had to put up with for years so bad for the usa
the economy is doing great with tremendous upside potential if the fed would do what they should we are a rocket upward
the farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for ethanol not even including the e year around which is already done it will be a giant package get ready at the same time i was able to save the small refineries from certain closing great for all
perhaps never in the history of our country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than james comey in the just released inspector generals report he should be ashamed of himself
establishment of the us space command 
general motors which was once the giant of detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there they moved major plants to china before i came into office this was done despite the saving help given them by the usa now they should start moving back to america again
an idea liked by many 
the disastrous ig report on james comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly i and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool we should be given our stolen time back
the fact that james comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable attorney general bill barr is so many people and experts that i have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course comey got lucky
bryan dean wright former cia officerdem in we had a coup we have to take comey and others to task makes no sense not to prosecute him comey got a book deal i fear for my country he tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences fs
the euro is dropping against the dollar like crazy giving them a big export and manufacturing advantageand the fed does nothing our dollar is now the strongest in history sounds good doesnt it except to those manufacturers that make product for sale outside the us
we dont have a tariff problem we are reigning in bad andor unfair players we have a fed problem they dont have a clue
if the fed would cut we would have one of the biggest stock market increases in a long time badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small tariffs instead of themselves for bad managementand who can really blame them for doing that excuses
the united states of america was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the safir slv launch at semnan launch site one in iran i wish iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at site one 
thanks true 
one of the most disgraceful examples of an abuse of power by a government officialwhen you read this reportthis is a systematic effort to go after candidate trump president electtrump and president trumpyou could virtually call this an attempted coup twittercomethclvrke
fallout from ig's scathing comey report 
this should never happen to another president again 
the great state of north carolina has early voting for a very important congressional ninth race please vote early now or on election day september th for dan bishop a great guy his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities is weak on crime military vets
just arrived at camp david
they could have charged comey with theft of government documents of the criminal code because the ig found these were not his personal documents these were government documents comeys claim that these were just his own personal recollections would not
pass the laugh test and the inspector general just knocked that down 
i am monitoring hurricane dorian and receiving frequent briefings and updates it is important to heed the directions of your state and local officials this is an extremely dangerous storm please prepare and be safe 
thank you kevin great things are happening at the border 
great job thom 
one of the greats 
nobody works harder or smarter than joni 
an amazing guy respected by all 
nobody knows more about healthcare than john great guy 
cory is doing a great job for colorado 
the ig found that james comey leaked classified documents to his attorneys which can be is a violation of the espionage act this is consistent with all the lies that comey has been spreading 
while madeleine westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement she is a very good person and i dont think there would ever be reason to use it she called me yesterday to apologize had a bad night i fully understood and forgave her i love tiffany doing great
yes i am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements disgusting and foul mouthed omarosa is one i gave her every break despite the fact that she was despised by everyone and she went for some cheap money from a book numerous others also
a great team working hard 
i was right about comey crooked cop
make america great again which is happening and then keep america great
looking like our great south carolina could get hit much harder than first thought georgia and north carolina also its moving around and very hard to predict except that it is one of the biggest and strongest and really wide that we have seen in decades be safe
dan will be great 
has anyone noticed that the top shows on and cable ratings are those that are fair or great to your favorite president me congratulations to for being the number one show on cable television
just watched congresswoman debbie dingell and many other democrats wanting to give up on our very successful trade battle with china which has had its worst economic year in memory and getting worse we are taking in billions will be big for farmers and all
being scolded by failed former intelligence officials like james clapper on my condolences to iran on their failed rocket launch sadly for the united states guys like him comey and the even dumber john brennan dont have a clue they really set our country back
but now we are moving forward like never before we are winning again and we are respected again
enjoy the low gas prices over the labor day weekend my energy policies have made america energy independent while keeping prices low just like a tax cut the democrats green policies will raise your price of gas 
the vindication belongs to the president for firing james comey it was clearly the right thing to do you dont want an fbi director with jim comeys ethics jason riley wall street journal
just briefed by attorney general barr about the shootings in texas fbi and law enforcement is fully engaged more to follow
peter morici economist tariffs will not impact american consumers that much because the chinese currency has gone down which gives our importers a discount importers can find suppliers outside of china absolutely worth it we dont want to be servants to the chinese this
is about american freedom redirect the supply chain there is no reason to buy everything from china
james comey has been rebuked at the highest level with much more to come an ig report doesnt get any stronger calling him dangerous insubordinate thank goodness that donald trump was elected because if he wasnt elected these people would still be in power two more
reports are coming comey very vulnerable but where is the supreme court where is justice roberts if you lie to a court you should be held in contempt so if you abused the fisa you must be held accountable i hope justice roberts will take action jason chaffetz fox
comey and mccabe and more are dirty cops joe digenova
i have not forgotten that when it was announced that i was going to do the apprentice and when it then became a big hit helping nbcs failed lineup greatly came up to me at an upfront profusely thanked me even calling me sir how times have changed
this is only the beginning 
in addition to florida south carolina north carolina georgia and alabama will most likely be hit much harder than anticipated looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever already category be careful god bless everyone
great job by texas law enforcement and first responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday thank you also to the fbi and all others a very tough and sad situation
pray for the people in the bahamas being hit like never before category almost mph winds
we hold that legislative prayer is government speech not open to attack via those channels third circuit court of appeals lou thats why this next election is so important the soul of america they want to take religion out of american lives thank god for judges like
this judge thomas ambro majotity opinion and thank god for a president like donald j trump who will appoint judges like this he will soon have appointed new federal judges not even including two great new supreme court justices 
when you put everything together the pro growth tax regulation cuts help to retrain workers the tariffs which encourage manufacturers to come back to america along with president trumps tough approach on immigration strong stance on illegals promoting merit based it
adds up to the most ambitious proworker policy agenda this country has ever seen the president promised jobs jobs jobs and that is exactly what he is delivering 
since my election many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our country and the stock market is up over if you followed the advice of the failing new york times columnist paul krugman youd be doing very poorly youd be angry and hurt he never got it
just watched aflcio president richard trumka on and thought to myself how different he is on tv than he is when he is with me at the white house likes what we are doing until the cameras go on we got robbed on trade and everything else while his dems just sat back
and watched nafta is the worst trade deal ever made terrible for labor and richard let it stand no wonder unions are losing so much the workers will vote for me in lowest unemployment most jobs ever and should stop paying exorbitant dues not worth it
they are liars and in my opinion traitors talking about comey and his dwindling group of friends
the last three years of trump policy have finally brought real hope and real change unemployment this year hit a year low with president trump weve seen the lowest ever african american and hispanic unemployment the booming trump economy has pushed up workers wages
average hourly wages growth has far outpaced what we saw with president obama across all industries from mining and construction to leisure hospitality with president trump we see income growth in states like iowa ohio pennsylvania wisconsin nevada florida
swing states that went to trump in because he promised not to forget about them like the establishment had done for decades and their trust in president trump paid off as they saw their incomes riseand its the lowest paid workers who have gained the most with
trump economics with president trump tariffs are bringing companies back to the usa like he said they would 
the amazon washington post did a story that i brought racist attacks against the squad no they brought racist attacks against our nation all i do is call them out for the horrible things they have said the democrats have become the party of the squad
the lamestream media has gone totally crazy they write whatever they want seldom have sources even though they say they do never do fact checking anymore and are only looking for the kill they take good news and make it bad they are now beyond fake they are corrupt
the good news is that we are winning our real opponent is not the democrats or the dwindling number of republicans that lost their way and got left behind our primary opponent is the fake news media in the history of our country they have never been so bad
such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter of i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true they made a big deal about this
when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some hurt always good to be prepared but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling didnt play my whole sentence or statement bad people
brazil will allow more american ethanol to enter the country without tariffs a decision that brazilian mills are celebrating the seemingly counterintuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the south american nation and the us for a
trade agreement making great progress for our farmers approved e year round big additional list to be submitted approved within two weeks will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries
we are doing very well in our negotiations with china while i am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of ripoff usa byear months plus is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a longshot
and then think what happens to china when i win deal would get much tougher in the meantime chinas supply chain will crumble and businesses jobs and money will be gone
for all of the geniuses out there many who have been in other administrations and taken to the cleaners by china that want me to get together with the eu and others to go after china trade practices remember the eu all treat us very unfairly on trade also will change
germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates they get paid for loaning money and our federal reserve fails to act remember these are also our weak currency competitors
based on the ig report the whole witch hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal scam the house of representatives should now get back to work on drug prices healthcare infrastructure and all else the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction
the incompetent mayor of london sadiq khan was bothered that i played a very fast round of golf yesterday many pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks me i run through one of my courses very inexpensive president obama would fly to hawaii kahn should focus on
knife crime which is totally out of control in london people are afraid to even walk the streets he is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business
the us may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to hurricane dorian but please dont let down your guard as it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen on the other hand the bahamas have been devastated we are sending crews to help
at the request of senator thom tillis i am getting the north carolina emergency declaration completed and signed tonight hope you wont need it
the truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the fbi we have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country thanks comey its a scandal 
i am so tired of hearing the rationalization of the left in the country because they hate donald trump inexplicably and without foundation they choose to hate america the democrats have truly become the party of hate 
to declassify is so important because if this were a democrat president or a democrat candidate that was spied on the way president trump was spied on this would be a scandal that would make watergate look like nothing illegal spying
on the president of the united states 
us winning trade war with china in dollars cnbc
the chinese are very adept at not accepting anything youve got to be very tough and thats what trump is doing its in chinas interest to correct and i think well end up with a solution thats dramatically better than we have today frankly i think the impact of what
trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever theyre sitting there and saying gee are we next maybe you are weve got to change the rules the us cant defend the world and pay for it
we cant have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which have long charged us big tariffs dont keep ducking the reality the us has been subject to tariff terrorism for years but a real deal can be done sam zell 
 facts that will ignore in tonights climate forum
 which country has the largest carbon emission reduction america who has dumped the most carbon into the air china of the worlds population are exposed to air pollution above the world health organizations suggested level none are in the usa
 the us now leads the world in energy production but who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water america
 the democrats destructive environmental proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump don't the democrats care about fighting american poverty
 the badly flawed paris climate agreement protects the polluters hurts americans and cost a fortune not on my watch i want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet weve now got that
state rep greg murphy is running for congress in north carolina district we really need greg in washington he is great w the military our vets your a strong on crime and the border has had my total endorsement for a long time please vote for greg on september th
this was the originally projected path of the hurricane in its early stages as you can see almost all models predicted it to go through florida also hitting georgia and alabama i accept the fake news apologies 
absolutely nothing is more important than going back getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation we had an administration using americas spying apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election those are all known undisputed
facts and that should terrify every american regardless of their political stripe the idea that all of that information hasnt already been revealed shows how dastardly these people are and how terrified they are about whats going to happen when that
information does come out charlie hurt washington times 
thank you terrence best employment numbers in history for african americans 
in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida to the gulf
instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed in the path it took no read my full fema statement what i said was accurate all fake news in order to demean
bad actress debra the mess messing is in hot water she wants to create a blacklist of trump supporters is being accused of mccarthyism is also being accused of being a racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness if roseanne barr
said what she did even being on a much higher rated show she would have been thrown off television will fake news nbc allow a mccarthy style racist to continue abc fired roseanne watch the double standard
alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then hurricane dorian took a different path up along the east coast the fake news knows this very well thats why theyre the fake news
really good jobs numbers
after almost years in my administration jason greenblatt will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer
his dedication to israel and to seeking peace between israel and the palestinians wont be forgotten he will be missed thank you jason
just as i said alabama was originally projected to be hit the fake news denies it 
i was with you all the way alabama the fake news media was not 
just talked to governor roy cooper of north carolina as hurricane dorian ominously comes up the east coast we are monitoring it at the ready to assist via our great team over at who are already on site we are with you all the way north carolina be safe
just spoke to governor of south carolina regarding hurricane dorian i informed henry that we are monitoring south carolina and stand by ready to assist be safe everyone we are totally with you
just got off the phone with governor brian kemp of georgia happy to hear that things are looking good for everyone i stand by ready to assist along with our great team at were with you all the way
great job done by senator and all of the those from florida that were so brilliantly involved including law enforcement and first responders thank you all
looking forward to watching sanders tomorrow morning on by far the rated show on morning cable at am sarah will be an incredible addition to 
i think president trump is set in his ways because he doesnt see any weakening i mean look at the joblessness report today what im surprised at is how strong the consumer is i think the chinese need it a deal more than we do its statistical i just think
that our economy is very strong if the fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be then i really wouldnt worry about a recession 
the immigration law institutes christopher hajec says the supreme court has to look st whether daca is lawful what they are looking at now is whether trumps recision of daca is lawful must consider lawfulness of daca itself looks very odd that president trump doesnt
have the discretion to end the program that president obama began in his discretion that program was unlawful to begin with i think its very unlikely that the scotus is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program daca is unlawful 
president obama never had the legal right to sign daca and he indicated so at the time of signing but in any event how can he have the right to sign and i dont have the right to unsigned totally illegal document which would actually give the president new powers
daca will be going before the supreme court it is a document that even president obama didnt feel he had the legal right to sign he signed it anyway rest assured that if the sc does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all
i agree with the fed should lower rates they were way too early to raise and way too late to cut and big dose quantitative tightening didnt exactly help either where did i find this guy jerome oh well you cant win them all
congratulations to and his sister on a great success what a wonderful thing to do
great interview of sarah sanders by she is a terrific person with a great future
our great has just written a book that will add to the tremendous success of her last number one best seller its called radicals resistance and revenge the lefts plot to remake america it is a fantastic book go get it 
larry kudlow on now
the fake news media was fixated on the fact that i properly said at the beginnings of hurricane dorian that in addition to florida other states alabama may also be grazed or hit they went crazy hoping against hope that i made a mistake which i didnt check out maps
this nonsense has never happened to another president four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology but there are many things that the fake news media has not apologized to me for like the witch hunt or spygate the lamestream media and their democrat
partner should start playing it straight it would be so much better for our country
great job by fema law enforcement first responders us coast guard and all keep going we all appreciate what you are doing
the economy is great the only thing adding to uncertainty is the fake news
china is eating the tariffs billions pouring into usa targeted patriot farmers getting massive dollars from the incoming tariffs good jobs numbers no inflationfed china having worst year in decades talks happening good for all
the washington posts lost summer 
the and all others along with other countries that have been helping have been asked to move people in the badly hit sections of the bahamas to other sections of the bahamas
that were not hit and that are in good condition any cruise ship companies willing to act as stationary housing etc i am sure would be appreciated
promises made promises kept 
china just enacted a major stimulus plan with all the tariffs they are paying to the usa billions and billions of dollars they need it in the meantime our federal reserve sits back and does nothing
thank you to bahamian prime minister hubert minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the united states and me their would have been many more casualties i give all credit to fema the us coast guard the brave people of the bahamas
i would also like to thank papa doug manchester hopefully the next ambassador to the bahamas for the incredible amount of time money and passion he has spent on helping to bring safety to the bahamas much work to be done by the bahamian government we will help 
i want to congratulate mitch mcconnell and all republicans today i signed the th federal judge to the bench within a short period of time we will be at over federal judges including many in the appellate courts two great new us supreme court justices
the washington posts mr off the record two nasty lightweight reporters shouldnt even be allowed on the grounds of the white house because their reporting is so disgusting fake also add the appointment of many federal judges this summer 
in years of patrolling our southern border i have never seen mexico act like a true border security partner until president trump got involved and now they are stepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do brandon judd national border patrol
russia and ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners very good news perhaps a first giant step to peace congratulations to both countries
congratulations to the great jerry west 
jobs jobs jobs 
our economy is doing great 
the failing new york times stated in an article written by obama flunky peter baker who lovingly wrote obama bookeven after the president forecast the storm to include alabama this is not true i said very early on that it may even hit alabama a big difference
fake news i would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the lamestream media just wont let it alone they always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding deceiving the public the public knows that the media is corrupt
unbeknownst to almost everyone the major taliban leaders and separately the president of afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp david on sunday they were coming to the united states tonight unfortunately in order to build false leverage they admitted to
an attack in kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers and other people i immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations what kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position they didnt they
only made it worse if they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill innocent people then they probably dont have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway how many more decades are they willing to fight
leakin lyin james comey 
we are building the wall 
looking forward to being in the north carolina tomorrow night were having a big rally for a great guy dan bishop strong on crime borders your military and our vets we need dan bishop in washington badly his opponent is weak on crime borders and against your nd a
congratulations to pirro on having again the number one best selling book
when all of the people pushing so hard for criminal justice reform were unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help i got it done with a group of senators others who would never have gone for it obama couldnt come close
a man named and many others were profusely grateful at that time i signed it into law no one else did republicans deserve much credit but now that it is passed people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise guys like boring
musician and his filthy mouthed wife are talking now about how great it is but i didnt see them around when we needed help getting it passed anchor doesnt even bring up the subject of president trump or the republicans when talking about
the importance or passage of criminal justice reform they only talk about the minor players or people that had nothing to do with itand the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed all they talk about now is impeaching president trump
maria john understood the dishonesty deception from the very beginning 
north carolina vote for dan bishop tomorrow we need him badly in washington his opponent is a far left sanctuary cities supporter
when the former governor of the great state of south carolina was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on the appalachian trail then was found in argentina with his flaming dancer friend it sounded like his political career was over it was
but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his reelect after i tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent but now take heart he is back and running for president of the united states the three stooges all badly failed candidates will give it a go
house republicans should allow chairs of committees to remain for longer than years it forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving the dems have unlimited terms while that has its own problems it is a better way to go fewer people in the end will leave
 approval rating in the republican party a record thank you
great news that an activist investor is now involved with att as the owner of very low ratings perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the fake news emanating from its noncredible anchors also i hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune
but most importantly is bad for the usa their international division spews bad information fake news all over the globe this is why foreign leaders are always asking me why does the media hate the us sooo much it is a fraudulent shame all comes from the top
as bad as is comcast msnbc is worse their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility i believe their stories about me are not negative but actually negative they are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things
that this administration has done they dont talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the military choice at our va our vets judges and supreme court justices the border wall going up lowest crime numbers nd a and so much more
i know nothing about an air force plane landing at an airport which i do not own and have nothing to do with near turnberry resort which i do own in scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at turnberry they have good taste nothing to do with me
i had nothing to do with the decision of our great mike pence to stay overnight at one of the trump owned resorts in doonbeg ireland mikes family has lived in doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy european visit he would stop and see his family
the trump administration has achieved more in the first years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and thats all that is important
a lot of fake news is being reported that i overruled the vp and various advisers on a potential camp david meeting with the taliban this story is false i always think it is good to meet and talk but in this case i decided not to the dishonest media likes to create
the look of turmoil in the white house of which there is none i view much of the media as simply an arm of the democrat party they are corrupt and they are extremely upset at how well our country is doing under my leadership including
the economy where there is no recession much to the regret of the lamestream media they are working overtime to help the democrats win in but that will never happen americans are too smart
we have been serving as policemen in afghanistan and that was not meant to be the job of our great soldiers the finest on earth over the last four days we have been hitting our enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years
to every one of the heroes we recognized today thank you and god bless you all

abcwashington post poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the election when my lawyers protested they took a point down and brought it to almost even by election day it was a fake poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets sad
one of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the fake and corrupt news media is the phony polling information they put out many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad internal polling looks great the best ever
vote today for dan bishop will be great for north carolina and our country
i informed john bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the white house i disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions as did others in the administration and therefore
i asked john for his resignation which was given to me this morning i thank john very much for his service i will be naming a new national security advisor next week
incredible progress being made at the southern border 
one down one to go greg murphy is projected to win in the great state of north carolina 
excellent interview by on on very interesting and secure perspective on life
i am pleased to endorse governor mike parson of missouri he is very popular strong and knows what he is doing he gets it based on the fact that mike has announced he will run again in for governor mike parson has my complete and total endorsement
senator ben sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of nebraska he is great with our vets the military and your very important second amendment strong on crime and the border ben has my complete and total endorsement
dan bishop was down points weeks ago he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race big rally last night now it looks like he is going to win are moving their big studio equipment and talent out stay tuned
greg murphy is a big winner in north carolina much bigger margins than originally anticipated congratulations greg
big night for the republican party congratulations to all
 were all set to have a big victory until dan bishop won north carolina now you will hear them barely talk about or cover the race fake news never wins
alice stewart thank you for the nice words while on concerning the two big republican congressional victories youd be great on a network with much higher ratings keep up the good work
greg murphy won big to in north carolina the fake news barely covered the race the win was far bigger than anticipated there was just nothing the fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory so we had two big victories tonight greg dan
china suspends tariffs on some us products being hit very hard supply chains breaking up as many companies move or look to move to other countries much more expensive to china than originally thought 
the federal reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance our debt interest cost could be brought way down while at the same time substantially lengthening the term we have the great currency power and balance sheet
the usa should always be paying the the lowest rate no inflation it is only the navet of jay powell and the federal reserve that doesnt allow us to do what other countries are already doing a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of boneheads
in a hypothetical poll done by one of the worst pollsters of them all the amazon washington postabc which predicted i would lose to crooked hillary by points how did that work out sleepy joe pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the general election
this is a phony suppression poll meant to build up their democrat partners i havent even started campaigning yet and am constantly fighting fake news like russia russia russia look at north carolina last night dan bishop down big in the polls wins easier than 
if it werent for the never ending fake news about me and with all that i have done more than any other president in the first years i would be leading the partners of the lamestream media by points sorry but true
leaving the white house soon to speak at the pentagon my great honor
today and every day we pledge to honor our history to treasure our liberty to uplift our communities to live up to our values to prove worthy of our heroes and above all to never forget twittercomxbevlpy
big united states supreme court win for the border on asylum 
at the request of the vice premier of china liu he and due to the fact that the people's republic of china will be celebrating their th anniversary
on october st we have agreed as a gesture of good will to move the increased tariffs on billion dollars worth of goods to from october st to october th
i had an excellent telephone conversation with andrs manuel lpez obrador president of mexico talking about southern border security and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries
the southern border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by democrats not agreeing to do anything on loopholes or asylum
the wall is being built after victories against the democrats in various courts 
the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and elsewhere 
thank you brandon 
european central bank acting quickly cuts rates basis points they are trying and succeeding in depreciating the euro against the very strong dollar hurting us exports and the fed sits and sits and sits they get paid to borrow money while we are paying interest
it is expected that china will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products
some really big court wins on the border lately
dems have never gotten over the fact that president trump won the election mccarthy
we cant beat him so lets impeach him democrat rep al green
this should have been over with after the mueller report came out 
in fact my views on venezuela and especially cuba were far stronger than those of john bolton he was holding me back 
hello baltimore 
how do you impeach a president who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country all time best unemployment numbers especially for blacks hispanics asians women more people working today than ever before rebuilt military choice for vets
became number in world independent in energy will soon have record number of judges sc justices done more than any president in first years despite phony fraudulent witch hunt illegally led against him win on mueller report mueller testimony james comey
ig report which showed him to be a disgraced dirty cop republicans have unified like never before you dont impeach presidents for doing a good great job no obstruction no collusion only treasonous crimes committed by the other side and led by the democrats sad
illegal immigration costs the usa over billion dollars a year there is no reason for this and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier and faster but it will all happen anyway
very stupidly negotiated trade deals and illegal immigration are a tremendous cost and burden to our country they are both coming along very well and someday in the not too distant future america will see a very positive change remember america first
the two big congressional wins in north carolina on tuesday dan bishop and greg murphy have reverberated all over the world they showed a lot of people how strong the republican party is and how well it is doing is a big and very important election we will win
historic milestone indeed 
great news about the work we are doing on illegal immigration 
while i like the vaping alternative to cigarettes we need to make sure this alternative is safe for all lets get counterfeits off the market and keep young children from vaping
a very stable genius thank you
who the hell is joyann reid never met her she knows zero about me has no talent and truly doesnt have the it factor needed for success in showbiz had a bad reputation and now works for the comcastnbc losers making up phony stories about me low ratings fake news
 approval rating in the republican party tuesday night in the great state of north carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct
make america great again
keep america great
i had a call today with prime minister netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a mutual defense treaty between the united states and israel that would further anchor the tremendous alliance
between our two countries i look forward to continuing those discussions after the israeli elections when we meet at the united nations later this month
im ok with that 
the taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now killing people including one great american soldier was not a good idea there are much better ways to set up a negotiation the taliban knows they made a big mistake and they have no idea how to recover
amazing 
that is true and the usa is winning again 
my great honor 
thank you 
thank you billy 
all based on nothing the dems cant get anything positive done and probably dont want to 
now the radical left democrats and their partner the lamestream media are after brett kavanaugh again talking loudly of their favorite word impeachment he is an innocent man who has been treated horribly such lies about him they want to scare him into turning liberal
thank you and great interview
brett kavanaugh should start suing people for libel or the justice department should come to his rescue the lies being told about him are unbelievable false accusations without recrimination when does it stop they are trying to influence his opinions cant let that happen
cant let brett kavanaugh give radical left democrat liberal plus opinions based on threats of impeaching him over made up stories sound familiar false allegations and lies this is the game they play fake and corrupt news is working overtime 
i am fighting the fake corrupt news the deep state the democrats and the few remaining republicans in name only rinos who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation with the help of some truly great republicans and others we are winning big th federal judge this week
cant believe the wrote a positive front page story unity issue has parties pointing to trump gop goes all in while democrats clash over ideology tactics mr president we are with you the entire way republicans havecoalesced around trump
then on top of it all kathleen parker of all people wrote in case you were wondering trump won the debate true but what is going on at the not fake news
based on the attack on saudi arabia which may have an impact on oil prices i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if needed in a tobedetermined amount
sufficient to keep the markets wellsupplied i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states
saudi arabia oil supply was attacked there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed
plenty of oil
here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers get together and make a deal
the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran no conditions that is an incorrect statement as usual
we cannot have what happened to this president happen again joe digenova it is time for justice to come barreling in can you imagine that with everything going on in this world the witch hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along a disgrace
house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and spent zero collusion zero obstruction so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that trump has done over his lifetime but it doesnt
work that way i have a better idea look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the congressional slush fund and lastly the ig reports take a look at them those investigations would be over fast
the this week the senate passed a milestone in confirming the th federal judge of mr trumps administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping barack obamas pace and fulfilling pledges by mr trump and mr oconnell to remake the federal judiciary
these conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump nominees the entire court system is changing at a record pace
because we have done so well with energy over the last few years thank you mr president we are a net energy exporter now the number one energy producer in the world we dont need middle eastern oil gas in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies
producer prices in china shrank most in years due to chinas big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus federal reserve not watching will fed ever get into the game dollar strongest ever really bad for exports no inflationhighest interest rates
the united states because of the federal reserve is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries they cant believe how lucky they are that jay powell the fed dont have a clue and now on top of it all the oil hit big interest rate drop stimulus
the new york times walks back report on kavanaugh assault claim the one who is actually being assaulted is justice kavanaugh assaulted by lies and fake news this is all about the lamestream media working with their partner the dems
whats happening to justice kavanaugh is a disgrace this guy is not a good man he is a great man he has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him a disgrace dan bongino 
just out kavanaugh accuser doesnt recall incident do you believe what these horrible people will do or say they are looking to destroy and influence his opinions but played the game badly they should be sued
remember when iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their airspace when in fact it was nowhere close they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia well see
democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done governor john sununu the big questions are will they move the goalposts and is this just a ploy to take your guns away i hope not on both counts but ill be able to figure it out
they failed on the mueller report they failed on robert muellers testimony they failed on everything else so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president good idea except i will and have always expected to lose billions of dollars
for the privilege of being your president and doing the best job that has been done in many decades i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own these radical left democrats are crazy obama netflix
in a short while i will be presenting the new york the greatest relief pitcher closer of all time with the presidential medal of freedom in the east room of the 
big crowd expected in new mexico tonight where we will win your border wall is getting stronger each and every day see you in a few hours 
thank you working hard twittercomcpvcxhe
this afternoon at the it was my great honor to present our nations highest civilian honor the presidential medal of freedom to american baseball legend congratulations on this extraordinary achievement mo 
congratulations 
how many stories are wrong almost all of the stories the new york times has done are inaccurate and wrong the new york times should close its doors and throw away the keys the women mentioned in the kavanaugh story said she didnt even remember the event
i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story and while youre at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony theyve taken the old grey lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation
she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management the times is dead long live the new york times
on my way to new mexico see you all shortly at the 
keep america great 
beautiful evening in new mexico with great american patriots 
we are all united by the same love of country the same devotion to family and the same profound faith that america is blessed by the eternal grace of almighty god bound by these convictions we will campaign for every vote we will win the great state of new mexico in 
if you want to stop the drug smugglers human traffickers and vicious ms gang members from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth you have only one choice you must elect more republicans twittercomlnebvseo
the new york times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history not only is it losing a lot of money but it is a journalistic disaster being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves it has become a very sad joke all all over the world witch hunt hurt them
that story kavanaugh is nowhere near the standard that should be met in publishing a story 
just departed new mexico for california where we are delivering results 
such a beautiful opening statement by corey lewandowski thank you corey 
the new york times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence justice brett kavanaugh it wasnt the editor the times knew everything they are sick and desperate losing in so many ways
no lindsey it was a sign of strength that some people just dont understand 
as corey lewandowski stated very clearly yesterday in front of the house judiciary committee president trump didnt do anything wrong or illegal but they all know that the democrats are hurting our country and getting nothing done shameful 
the witch hunt is the greatest political scam in us history 
thank you corey 
great 
dummy beto made it much harder to make a deal convinced many that dems just want to take your guns away will continue forward 
terrence k williams you cant impeach trump for being a winner
so nice that our country is now energy independent the usa is in better shape than ever before strongest military by far biggest economy no longer even close number one in energy maga kag
i have just instructed the secretary of the treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of iran
i am pleased to announce that i will name robert c obrien currently serving as the very successful special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department as our new national security advisor i have worked long hard with robert he will do a great job
the trump administration is revoking californias federal waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially safer this will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety
 advantage and also due to the fact that older highly polluting cars will be replaced by new extremely environmentally friendly cars there will be very little difference in emissions between the california standard and the new us standard but the cars will be
far safer and much less expensive many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more jobs jobs jobs automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to california you will be out of business
happy nd birthday to our great 
jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no guts no sense no vision a terrible communicator
thank you 
all polls and some brand new polls show very little support for impeachment such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc
great progress on the border wall 
another fake news story out there it never ends virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various us agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem
knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa
presidential harassment
because of my administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost years but the american people need congress to help i like sen grassleys drug pricing bill very much and its great to see speaker pelosis bill today lets get it done in a bipartisan way
nice meeting with mark zuckerberg of in the oval office today 
great news just renewed her deal with fox i dont care how much they paid her they got a beautiful bargain congratulations to both
the us economy is the envy of the world as europe and asia slide ever toward recession but the left is trying to avoid talking about the trump economy the best is yet to come
oh no really big political news perhaps the biggest story in years part time mayor of new york city who was polling at a solid zero but had tremendous room for growth has shocking dropped out of the presidential race nyc is devastated hes coming home
the radical left democrats and their fake news media partners headed up again by little adam schiff and batting zero for against me are at it again they think i may have had a dicey conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a highly partisan whistleblowers
statement strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward do you know the reason why they did not because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect
thank you working hard 
rachel camposduffy has written a wonderful book for children paloma wants to be lady freedom she and her husband sean duffy have done so much for our country buy this book great for the kids 
i want to express my gratitude to americas magnificent for tonights exquisite evening where we celebrated more than a century of loyal and devoted friendship betweenboth of our nations are blessed by uncommon courage unfailing commitment and unyielding character 
the fake news media and their partner the democrat party want to stay as far away as possible from the joe biden demand that the ukrainian government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son or they wont get a very large amount of us money so they fabricate a
story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation i had with the new president of the ukraine nothing was said that was in any way wrong but bidens demand on the other hand was a complete and total disaster the fake news knows this but doesnt want to report
this is the real and only story 
now that the democrats and the fake news media have gone bust on every other of their witch hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the ukraine witch hunt while at the same time trying to protect sleepy joe biden will fail again
some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democratfake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen make america great again
the pretend ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the obamaclinton gang criminal classified leaks and spying targeting trump again 
it appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on trumps conversation
with a foreign leader was this person officially asked to listen to the conversation or was he or she secretly listening in 
theyre trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump scandal the problem is trump did nothing wrong
ukraine foreign minister disputes reports of any pressure from trump this conversation was long friendly and it touched on many questions correct if your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of sleepy joe he is being protected by the media
the lamestream media had a very bad week they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post they are the enemy of the people
the fake news media nowadays not only doesnt check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats it is so wrong but they dont even care anymore they have gone totally crazy
when someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the election as he did then he gets to set the national agenda the press is just outrages this story is the most irresponsible thing ive ever seen i agree they also lose too much
the real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs peter schweizer laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china he knew nothing about energy or anything else
go across the world and youll see either very low interest rates or negative rates the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i dont think hell fire jay powell even if i should we should always be paying less interest than others
i go along with joe 
they are trying to destroy and influence justice kavanaugh a very good man correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are
will be in houston to be with my friend will be a great day in texas 
the is trying to make someone justice kavanaugh into an evil person when they dont have the information to back it up it is a false hoax zero people were fired at the times why
look forward to being with our great india loving community 
justice kavanaugh should sue the failing new york times for all they are worth
the usa loves india 
incredible 
now the fake news media says i pressured the ukrainian president at least times during my telephone call with him this supposedly comes from a socalled whistleblower who they say doesnt even have a first hand account of what was said more democratcrooked media con
breaking news the ukrainian government just said they werent pressured at all during the nice call sleepy joe biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his sons company by threat of not giving big dollars to ukraine thats the real story
just leaving the great state of ohio for new york and a few big days at the united nations your country will be well represented
the very thing that they are accusing president trump of doing which i didnt do was actually done by joe biden continues to be a double standard these people are stone cold crooked also who is this socalled whistleblower who doesnt
know the correct facts is he on our countrys side where does he come from is this all about schiff the democrats again after years of being wrong
this is the real corruption that the fake news media refuses to even acknowledge 
thank you working hard 
 approval rating in the republican party thank you
 twittercomiizugqjehp
 bombshell information reports that the socalled whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of that phone conversation with ukraines president wow it is all a democratadam schiff scam doing this for years now and found nothing
she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future so nice to see 
true a wonderful meeting 
i am currently at the united nations representing our country but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with president zelensky of ukraine
you will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time
thank you 
the democrats are so focused on hurting the republican party and the president that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc so bad for our country
such an important day at the united nations so much work and so much success and the democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news witch hunt garbage so bad for our country
pelosi nadler schiff and of course maxine waters can you believe this
they never even saw the transcript of the call a total witch hunt
presidential harassment
secretary of state pompeo recieved permission from ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call i had with their president they dont know either what the big deal is a total witch hunt scam by the democrats
attorney for antitrump whistleblower worked for hillary clinton chuck schumer 
mark levin media trying to protect biden ignoring massive democrat scandal 
they dems are scrambling for a theme and narrative they've gone everywhere from russian hoax to russian collusionand now they've come to thisthey think they should have won the election they think in their bizarre brains that they did 
thank you totally agree 
sooooo true 
he trump has already been suffering from this type of a witch hunt since before his inauguration if its not one thing its another its a disgrace twittercomikxobv
thank you 
thank you and 
great new book by the brilliant andrew mccarthy ball of collusion the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency get it and some other great new books which i will soon be recommending they tell you about the crooked pols and the witch hunt that has now been exposed
there has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as i have the democrats are frozen with hatred and fear they get nothing done this should never be allowed to happen to another president witch hunt
the democrats have been talking about impeaching donald trump since before he was inaugurated and for no reason other than the great success we are having with the economy the military vets tax and regulation cuts healthcare and so much more
will the democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the ukrainian president they should a perfect call got them by surprise
democrats wrote to the ukrainian government in may urging it to continue investigations into president donald trumps alleged collusion with russia in the presidential campaign collusion later found not to exist 
you dont see a direct quid pro quo in this 
he president trump didnt specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo ofunless you investigate thiswere going to withhold military aid to you pamela brown
wow ukraine whistleblowers lead attorney donated to biden 
i have informed kevin mccarthy and all republicans in the house that i fully support transparency on socalled whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from joe biden and his son hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily
taken out of ukraine and china additionally i demand transparency from democrats that went to ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat
so true but it will never work 
one of our best fundraising days ever 
so cute her father is under siege for no reason since his first day in office 
so bad for our country 
if they actually did this the markets would crash do you think it was luck that got us to the best stock market and economy in our history it wasnt 
thank you jim 
the greatest scam in the history of american politics
is there a case for impeachment absolutely not there is no high crime or misdemeanor no crime no extortion no treason robert ray 
that and many other reasons is why republicans will win north carolina 
a whistleblower with second hand information another fake news story see what was said on the very nice no pressure call another witch hunt
adam schiff has zero credibility another fantasy to hurt the republican party
liddle adam schiff who has worked unsuccessfully for years to hurt the republican party and president has just said that the whistleblower even though he or she only had second hand information is credible how can that be with zero info and a known bias democrat scam
congratulations to my friend our powerful appropriations chairman for his hard work on many strong bills that continue to rebuild our military invest in border security and many other priorities good work and keep fighting you are winning
no one has done more behind the scenes for strong border security than her bill passed committee today with b for the border wall west virginia is a great state and shelley gets it done keep it up
the president of ukraine said that he was not pressured by me to do anything wrong cant have better testimony than that as vp biden had his son on the other hand take out millions of dollars by strong arming the ukrainian president also looted millions from china bad
will be a great and very accurate show tonight by on pm will play my full statement from air force one
so many lies by sleepy joe and the do nothing democrats 
to show you how dishonest the lamestream media is i used the word liddle not liddle in discribing corrupt congressman liddle adam schiff low ratings purposely took the hyphen out and said i spelled the word little wrong a small but never ending situation with cnn
obama loving wrote obama book peter baker of the failing new york times married to an even bigger trump hater than himself should not even be allowed to write about me every story is a made up disaster with sources and leakers that dont even exist i had a simple and very
nice call with with the new president of ukraine it could not have been better or more honorable and the fake news media and democrats working as a team have fraudulently made it look bad it wasnt bad it was very legal and very good a continuing witch hunt
rep adam schiff fraudulently read to congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the president of ukraine that doesnt exist he was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it
sound horrible and me sound guilty he was desperate and he got caught adam schiff therefore lied to congress and attempted to defraud the american public he has been doing this for two years i am calling for him to immediately resign from congress based on this fraud
iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet i said of course no
it was a perfect conversation with ukraine president
rep adam schiff totally made up my conversation with ukraine president and read it to congress and millions he must resign and be investigated he has been doing this for two years he is a sick man
the democrats are now to be known as the do nothing party
sounding more and more like the socalled whistleblower isnt a whistleblower at all in addition all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else a leaker or spy feeding it to him or her a partisan operative
if that perfect phone call with the president of ukraine isnt considered appropriate then no future president can ever again speak to another foreign leader
i am draining the swamp 
thank you to general mcmaster just more fake news

they are trying to stop me because i am fighting for you 
how do you impeach a president who has created the greatest economy in the history of our country entirely rebuilt our military into the most powerful it has ever been cut record taxes regulations fixed the va gotten choice for our vets after years so much more
the conversation with the new and very good ukraine president who told the fake news at the united nations that he was not pressured by me in any way shape or form should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent witch hunt others ended in ashes
the whistleblowers complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new president of ukraine the socalled whistleblower knew practically nothing in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic wrong just like liddle adam schiff
fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming libeling me he must resign from congress
wow they got caught end the witch hunt now 
it is disgraceful what the do nothing democrats are doing the impeachment scam but it is also disgraceful what they are not doing namely the usmca vote prescription drug price reduction gun safety infrastructure and much more
the only people that dont like my conversation with the new ukrainian president are those that heard rep adam schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the house and public words that i did not say but that he fabricated admitted to this fabrication sick
the fake news doesnt dare mention the corrupt democrats 
these are trumpedup charges 
will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in trump type districts we will win big 
so great mark 
investigating corruption is correct 
wishing a happy new year to all of those celebrating rosh hashanah in america israel and around the world 
like every american i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the socalled whistleblower represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way then schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress
his lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great chamber he wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the president of the united states i want schiff questioned at the highest level for fraud treason
in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the whistleblower was this person spying on the us president big consequences
these radical left do nothing democrats are doing great harm to our country they are lying cheating like never before in our countrys history in order to destabilize the united states of america its upcoming election they the fake news media are dangerous bad
all thats swirling around us now is impeachment we talk about it day and night its whats on the news there is nothing that has turned up that is impeachable our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare we need to get good stuff done let the people vote
we are going to have an election very shortly rep jeff van drew democrat of new jersey thank you just another witch hunt by nancy pelosi and the do nothing democrats
state department has stepped up hillary clinton email probe you mean the emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all pertained only to her daughters wedding and her yoga
nancy pelosi and the democrats cant put down the impeachment match they know they couldnt beat him in against hillary clinton and theyre increasingly aware of the fact that they wont win against him in and impeachment is the only tool they have to get
rid of donald j trump and the democrats dont care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the 
election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process they know the only impeachable offense that president trump has committed was beating hillary clinton in thats the unpardonable sin for which the democrats will never forgive him
if the democrats are successful in removing the president from office which they will never be it will cause a civil war like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal pastor robert jeffress 
this is about proving that donald trump was framed by the democrats twittercomgiadpbn
the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country
china trade turmoil china urging a calm and rational solution china is doing very poorly while the usa under your favorite presidents leadership continues to soar to new heights and despite the do nothing democrats we have just begun
the fake whistleblower complaint is not holding up it is mostly about the call to the ukrainian president which in the name of transparency i immediately released to congress the public the whistleblower knew almost nothing its nd hand description of the call is a fraud
rep adam schiff illegally made up a fake terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people it bore no relationship to what i said on the call arrest for treason
after many years the united states is finally waking up to beijings plans and ambitions to pass us as the dominant economic military superpower in the st century whats happening now is that the us is finally responding thank you president trump this is taking
place in trade its taking shape in military competition johnathan ward author and china expert we are winning and we will win they should not have broken the deal we had with them happy birthday china
again the president of ukraine said there was no zero pressure put on him by me case closed
who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report drain the swamp
president trumps job approval numbers have just reached the highest level since his inauguration around and you can add to that many votes from voters that dont talk about their vote once they saw the presidents numbers going up they said we gotta do something so
they made this whole thing up impeachment is also a preemptive strike for what they think is coming on the obama administrations handling of the election jim mclaughlin highly respected pollster 
very simple i was looking for corruption and also why germany france and others in the european union dont do more for ukraine why is it always the usa that does so much and puts up so much money for ukraine and other countries by the way the bidens were corrupt
the fake news media wants to stay as far away as possible from the ukraine and china deals made by the bidens a corrupt media is so bad for our country in actuality the media may be even more corrupt than the bidens which is hard to do

congratulations to president xi and the chinese people on the th anniversary of the peoples republic of china
the congratulatory phone call with the ukrainian president was perfect unless you heard liddle adam schiffs fraudulently made up version of the call this is just another fake news media together with their partner the democrat party hoax
so if the socalled whistleblower has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my perfect call with the ukrainian president is wrong much to the embarrassment of pelosi schiff why arent we entitled to interview learn everything about
the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him this is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer warmer or better no pressure at all as confirmed by ukrainian pres it is just another democrat hoax
as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected fed rate too high they are their own worst enemies they dont have a clue pathetic
why isnt congressman adam schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the president of the united states this should never be allowed
republicans of louisiana it is really important for you to go out and vote on october th for either eddie rispone or ralph abraham both great which will lead to a runoff against

as i learn more and more each day i am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment it is a coup intended to take away the power of the
people their vote their freedoms their second amendment religion military border wall and their godgiven rights as a citizen of the united states of america
the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country 
louisiana republicans must go out and vote republican in your governors race a republican will win if you can force a runoff early voting has started your nd amendment and much else is at stake
i won the right to be a presidential candidate in california in a major court decision handed down yesterday it was filed against me by the radical left governor of that state to tremendous media hoopla the victory however was barely covered by the fake news no surprise
massive sections of the wall are being built at our southern border it is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the border patrol experts it is actually an amazing structure our us military is doing a great job
congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine it was perfect fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine he is sick
all the do nothing democrats are focused on is impeaching the president for having a very good conversation with the ukrainian president i knew that many people were listening even have a transcript they have been at this stuff from the day i got elected bad for country
nancy pelosi and the democrats havent met the standards of impeachment they have to be very careful here jeanne zaino 
now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news
all of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the stock market and your ks down but that is exactly what the democrats want to do they are willing to hurt the country with only the election in mind
nancy pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices working on the desperately needed usmca she is incapable of working on either it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud
democrats are trying to undo the election regardless of facts 
adam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of secretary of state mike pompeo for a lowlife like schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to congress as though they were said by me to demean a first in class at west point is sad
the do nothing democrats should be focused on building up our country not wasting everyones time and energy on bullshit which is what they have been doing ever since i got overwhelmingly elected in get a better candidate this time youll need it

the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country 
blowing massive holes inside of the theory the narrative that chairman schiff has been providing to the public twittercomcujhikzfgr
as the president of the united states i have an absolute right perhaps even a duty to investigate or have investigated corruption and that would include asking or suggesting other countries to help us out
another big loss for the do nothing dems 
the do nothing democrats dont have time to get it done 
aoc is a wack job 
great job jim 
we are simultaneously fighting the fake news media and their partner the democrat party always tough to beat the press but people are beginning to see how totally corrupt they are and it makes our job a whole lot easier

nancy pelosi today on actually said that adam schiffty schiff didnt fabricate my words in a major speech before congress she either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied even clinton lover strongly called her out sue her
the washington times ukraine envoy blows massive hole into democrat accusations republicans at hearing find no trump pressure the ukrainian president also strongly stated that no pressure was put on him case closed
as president i have an obligation to end corruption even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries it is done all the time this has nothing to do with politics or a political campaign against the bidens this does have to do with their corruption
breaking news unemployment rate at drops to a year low wow america lets impeach your president even though he did nothing wrong
the whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the democrat controlled house intelligence committee schiff never told us about this
when your making an unsubstantiated statement that the president is making a claim having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statement the ambassador put a dagger in the heart of schiffs fairytale rep lee zeldin
the witness was asked at least times and there definitely was no quid pro quo their whole case was built around this now they no longer mention
i think its outrages that a whistleblower is a cia agent ed rollins 
wow this is big stuff 
under my administration medicare advantage premiums next year will be their lowest in the last years we are providing great healthcare to our seniors we cannot let the radical socialists take that away through medicare for all

when your making an unsubstantiated charge that the president of the united states is making a request having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statementthe ambassador put a dagger in the heart of schiffs fairytale rep lee zeldin 
lyin shifty schiff 
adam schiffs connection to the whistleblower is coming to light these facts and others make it impossible for the ridiculous impeachment scam to go forward schiff has also committed a crime perhaps treason in making up a horrible statement and reading
it to congress and the american people as though it was the statement of the president of the united states me he did it to fool congress and the public in order to make me look bad he is a sick puppy

it isnt often i get angry at the dirty politics of the democrats in congress but this time i am enraged and hope this impeachment charade will backfire on reps pelosi schiff the democrats i have read thoroughly the telephone conversation between trump the president
of ukraine and cannot find any reason to charge the president with high crimes misdemeanors this is just a phony witch hunt perpetuated by democrats to get rid of trump because they cannot beat him in a fair election richard ketay
exenvoy testified ukraine or the president of ukraine never raised quid pro quo concerns with him source the president of ukraine also stated that he was not pressured by me in any way end of case
thanks jim would be great to just run our country 
where is the lamestream media on this

shifty schiff duped by russian pranksters 
thank you and 
new extreme dems now running the party 
the media is fixed and corrupt it bears no relationship to the truth the are pure fiction totally dishonest reporting
the socalled whistleblowers account of my perfect phone call is way off not even close schiff and pelosi never thought i would release the transcript of the call got them by surprise they got caught this is a fraud against the american people
somebody please wake up mitt romney and tell him that my conversation with the ukrainian president was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on china pertained to corruption not politics if mitt worked this hard on obama he could have won sadly he choked
mitt romney never knew how to win he is a pompous ass who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his senate run i gave it to him and when he begged me to be secretary of state i didnt give it to him he is so bad for rs
this is the real story twittercomawrtyshjql
schiff is a fraud twittercomizexunbs
not only are the do nothing democrats interfering in the election but they are continuing to interfere in the election they must be stopped
im hearing that the great people of utah are considering their vote for their pompous senator mitt romney to be a big mistake i agree he is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the do nothing democrats 
no kevin jeff flake is better 
so crooked hillary clinton can delete and acid wash emails after getting a subpoena from the united states congress but i cant make one totally appropriate telephone call to the president of ukraine witch hunt
mitt get off the stage youve had your turn twice 
schiff and the do nothing dems have lost all credibilitybut the corrupt media is working hard to keep them in the game 
president trump would be negligent if he did not bring this matter biden up if the vp of the us is self enriching engaged in criminal behavior at a minimum corrupt behavior it ought to be looked at peter schweizer author secret empires 
the first socalled second hand information whistleblower got my phone conversation almost completely wrong so now word is they are going to the bench and another whistleblower is coming in from the deep state also with second hand info meet with shifty keep them coming
the great scam is being revealed 
the do nothing democrats are being exposed 
 approval rating in republican party thank you
the democrats are lucky that they dont have any mitt romney types they may be lousy politicians with really bad policies open borders sanctuary cities etc but they stick together
it is incredible to watch and read the fake news and how they pull out all stops to protect sleepy joe biden and his thrown out of the military son hunter who was handed a month plusplus from a ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy
and separately got billion dollars from china despite no experience and for no apparent reason there is no way these can be legitimate transactions as lawyers others have stated as president i have an obligation to look into possible or probable corruption
the biden family was paid off pure and simple the fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable sleepy joe said he never spoke to the ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and hunter
and by the way i would love running against joe biden i just dont think its going to happen sleepy joe wont get to the starting gate based on all of the money he his family probably extorted joe should hang it up i wouldnt want him dealing with china u

sleepy eyes chuck todd of meet the press had a total meltdown in his interview with highly reaspected senator seems that a not very bright chuck just wasnt getting the answers he was looking for in order to make me look as bad as possible i did nothing wrong
gerry baker of do you think what youve seen rises to the level of impeachment ken starr clinton special prosecutor i dont
unemployment rate just dropped to the lowest in more that years is that an impeachable event for your president
 forgot to report that we are helping the great farmers of the usa to the tune of billion dollars for the last two years paid for out of tariffs paid to the united states by china for targeting the farmer they devalued their currency therefore paying the cost
nancy pelosi knew of all of the many shifty adam schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon congress and the american people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan whistleblower lawyer
this makes nervous nancy every bit as guilty as liddle adam schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors and even treason i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly colluded with them must all be immediately impeached
the united states was supposed to be in syria for days that was many years ago we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area we quickly defeated of the isis caliphate
including capturing thousands of isis fighters mostly from europe but europe did not want them back they said you keep them usa i said no we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in us prisons at tremendous cost they are yours for trials they
again said no thinking as usual that the us is always the sucker on nato on trade on everything the kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so they have been fighting turkey for decades i held off this fight for
almost years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win turkey europe syria iran iraq russia and the kurds will now have to
figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured isis fighters in their neighborhood they all hate isis have been enemies for years we are miles away and will crush isis again if they come anywhere near us
we just won the big court case on net neutrality rules a great win for the future and speed of the internet will lead to many big things including g congratulations to the fcc and its chairman ajit pai
ig declassified information contradicts the whistleblower but why are people surprised the partisan whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect no pressure call with the ukrainian president bring in another whistleblower from the bench
incomes much higher under trump than bush obama and almost everything else is better also except i am driving the deep state and the radical left do nothing democrats crazy
heritage foundation these numbers are blockbusters just since donald trump took office median family incomrs are up over in years under president obama they only went up in one third the time president trump has increased incomes times as much and that
doesnt even include the almost that the families got from the trump tax cut stephen moore freedomworks that means to more in disposable yearly income that americans have right now because of president trump
the radical left democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local new york city and state democrat prosecutors to go get president trump a thing like this has never happened to any president before not even close
i was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who dont even like the usa the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia china because they love seeing us bogged
down watching over a quagmire spending big dollars to do so when i took over our military was totally depleted now it is stronger than ever before the endless and ridiculous wars are ending we will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back blast
as i have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if turkey does anything that i in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits i will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of turkey ive done before they must with europe and others watch over
the captured isis fighters and families the us has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of of the isis caliphate it is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory the usa is great
the truth about impeachment twittercompezclfuk
thank you 
there are no felonies there are no impeachable offenses the constitutions very clear that you need bribery treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors you cant be impeached for the conduct thats been alleged in this case dershowitz a scam
great book 
adam should be impeached 
thank you joni 
the lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters ticket requests already dump frey and omar make america great again 
so many people conveniently forget that turkey is a big trading partner of the united states in fact they make the structural steel frame for our f fighter jet they have also been good to deal with helping me to save many lives at idlib province and returning in very
good health at my request pastor brunson who had many years of a long prison term remaining also remember and importantly that turkey is an important member in good standing of nato he is coming to the us as my guest on november th 
we may be in the process of leaving syria but in no way have we abandoned the kurds who are special people and wonderful fighters likewise our relationship with turkey a nato and trading partner has been very good turkey already has a large kurdish population and fully
understands that while we only had soldiers remaining in that section of syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency we are helping the kurds financiallyweapons
i would love to send ambassador sondland a really good man and great american to testify but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court where republicans rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public
to see importantly ambassador sondlands tweet which few report stated i believe you are incorrect about president trumps intentions the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind that says it all
i think that crooked hillary clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from uber left elizabeth warren only one condition the crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how why she deleted emails after getting c subpoena
thank you to lt bob kroll of the great minneapolis police department for your kind words on the police are fighting the radical left mayor and his ridiculous uniform ban actually i love the cops for trump shirts want to bring some home i am with you

radical left dem mayor of minneapolis jacob frey is doing everything possible to stifle free speech despite a record sellout crowd at the target center presidents clinton and obama paid almost nothing the minneapolis police have been incredible

gasoline prices in the state of california are much higher than anywhere else in the nation vs i guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just arent doing the trick dont worry california relief is on the way the state doesnt get it
the greatest witch hunt in the history of the usa 
bob mueller was pursuing the fbi director job when he met with president trump in administration officials say bret baier and jake gibson this is true even though mueller denied it
wow just breaking the big deal whistleblower had a professional tie to democratic candidate washington examiner in other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me why wasnt this reported by the icig a witch hunt scam
so amazing 
a total scam by the do nothing democrats for the good of the country this wirch hunt should end now 
the whistleblowers facts have been so incorrect about my no pressure conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly this is no whistleblower
the whistleblowers lawyer is a big democrat the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents why does the icig allow this scam to continue
he should be impeached for fraud 
so make all member countries pay not just the united states 
fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years usa should never have been in middle east moved our soldiers out turkey must take over captured isis fighters that europe refused to have returned the stupid endless wars for us are ending 
the united states has spent eight trillion dollars fighting and policing in the middle east thousands of our great soldiers have died or been badly wounded millions of people have died on the other side going into the middle east is the worst decision ever made
in the history of our country we went to war under a false now disproven premise weapons of mass destruction there were none now we are slowly carefully bringing our great soldiers military home our focus is on the big picture the usa is greater than ever before
the do nothing democrats are con artists only looking to hurt the republican party and president their total focus is nothing more and nothing less the good news is that we will win
the socalled whistleblower before knowing i was going to release the exact transcript stated that my call with the ukrainian president was crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security this is a very big lie read the transcript
no pressure at all said ukraine very congenial a perfect call the whistleblower and others spoke before seeing the transcript now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment
they dont have a clue but i do the usa is doing great despite the fed 
great support from gop in fighting the radical left do nothing democrats 
but we are now for the first time giving companies a better alternative 
so true don and this was a big lie look what happened to friends of trump for less cant let this pass 
adam schiff is a disgrace to our country 
why doesnt the icig do something about this scam he should have never let it start a dem hoax 
true should have never been there in the first place 
crooked hillary should try it again 
president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court he signed it anyway if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought if they do what is right and do not let
daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way
so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone elses campaign in order to win that didnt work out so well and if they were unable to fill important federal judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to choose will have soon
only percent want the president impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of fake news coverage but pretty high considering the fact that i did nothing wrong it is all just a continuation of the greatest scam and witch hunt in the history of our country
so pathetic to see sleepy joe biden who with his son hunter and to the detriment of the american taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment and i did nothing wrong joes failing campaign gave him no other choice
sleepy joe biden 
the hardest thing i have to do as president 
i dont think its a whistleblower at all i think this is an anonymous source for the democratic staff in the house of representatives this is an insult to real whistleblowers actual whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended john kiriakou 
a different take 
impeached for what having created the greatest economy in the history of our country building our strongest ever military cutting taxes too much 
in case the kurds or turkey lose control the united states has already taken the isis militants tied to beheadings in syria known as the beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the us they are the worst of the worst
ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky told reporters thursday his controversial july call with president trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachmentminded democrats claim this should immediately end the talk of impeachment 
from the day i announced i was running for president i have never had a good poll whoever their pollster is they suck but is also much different than it used to be in the good old days with people like andrew napolitano who wanted to be a supreme
court justice i turned him down hes been terrible ever since shep smith who gave crooked hillary the debate questions got fired from others doesnt deliver for us anymore it is so different than it used to be oh well im president
where is hunter biden he has disappeared while the fake news protects his crooked daddy 
turkey has been planning to attack the kurds for a long time they have been fighting forever we have no soldiers or military anywhere near the attack area i am trying to end the endless wars talking to both sides some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to
the area and start a new war all over again turkey is a member of nato others say stay out let the kurds fight their own battles even with our financial help i say hit turkey very hard financially with sanctions if they dont play by the rules i am watching closely
thank you to one america news for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting it is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful voice see you tonight at the big rally in minneapolis

wheres hunter
so funny to watch steve kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about china he chocked and looks weak and pathetic dont want him at the white house
i never saw so many subpoenas the democrats have gone crazy just read the transcript or listen to the new ukraine presidents statement no pressure this is a democrat con job impeach schiff for fraud
louisiana republicans thank you for a great evening get out tomorrow and vote republican send the radical democrat establishment a loud and clear message that you are going to fire your democrat governor john bel edwards and send a great republican to the governors mansion 
louisiana tomorrow you will head to the polls and vote to replace liberal democrat john bel edwards with a great new republican governor get out and vote for either or both great 
schiff aides worked with whistleblower schiff is a lying mess
the case of major mathew golsteyn is now under review at the white house mathew is a highly decorated green beret who is being tried for killing a taliban bombmaker we train our boys to be killing machines then prosecute them when they kill 
the deal i just made with china is by far the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our great patriot farmers in the history of our country in fact there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced our farmers will figure it out thank you china
other aspects of the deal are also great technology financial services billion in boeing planes etc but wow the farmers really hit pay dirt thank you to all republicans in congress for your invaluable help
louisiana get out and vote republican before going to the big game today a runoff will be a tremendous win for your great state lower taxes and car insurance and better protection of your nd amendment fantastic being with you last night
so now they are after the legendary crime buster and greatest mayor in the history of nyc rudy giuliani he may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer such a one sided witch hunt going on in usa deep state shameful
happy national farmers day 
that is the real story 
start thinking about getting bigger tractors 
the endless wars must end
the governor of louisiana john bel edwards has done a poor job now he is in a runoff with a great republican thank you louisiana down to after i explained what a bad job the governor was doing
the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand trillion dollars and many thousands of lives and millions of lives when you count the other side are now fighting to keep us there dont listen to people that havent got a clue they have proven to be inept
congratulations to the great state of louisiana a big night you will soon have a new and wonderful governor your taxes and car insurance payments will go down
a despicable human being 
the media is not talking about the big republican victory last night in louisiana where a sitting democrat governor was forced into a runoff by not getting big upset now who will be a great governor will win
very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight they have no idea what a bad decision they have made why are they not asking for a declaration of war
do you remember two years ago when iraq was going to fight the kurds in a different part of syria many people wanted us to fight with the kurds against iraq who we just fought for i said no and the kurds left the fight twice now the same thing is happening with turkey
the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other let them we are monitoring the situation closely endless wars
dealing with and many members of congress including democrats about imposing powerful sanctions on turkey treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought there is great consensus on this turkey has asked that it not be done stay tuned
wheres hunter he has totally disappeared now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries media is awol
we have become a far greater economic power than ever before and we are using that power for world peace
happy birthday 
the democrats are going to lose a lot of house seats because of their fraudulent use of impeachment schiff fabricated phone call a crime democrat senate seats will also be put at risk even some that were supposedly safe look at louisiana last night north carolina last week
my deal with china is that they will immediately start buying very large quantities of our agricultural product not wait until the deal is signed over the next or weeks they have already started likewise financial services and other deal aspects start preparing
i agreed not to increase tariffs from to on october th they will remain at the relationship with china is very good we will finish out the large phase one part of the deal then head directly into phase two the phase one deal can be finalized signed soon
china has already begun agricultural purchases from our great patriot farmers ranchers
congressman adam schiff who when seeing the real ukraine phone call transcript decided hed better make up one of his own im going to say this only seven times so you better listen good i want you to make up dirt on my political opponent understand lots of it and
by the way dont call me again ill call you when youve done what ive asked a reminder that wasnt just stupid it was false i never said this schiff made it up and read it to congress the american people end witch hunt
 on is doing a big show tonight on the democrats impeachment scam pm no guests just mark he is angry like so many others at pm on steve hilton is looking into the crooked bidens wheres hunter
the us has the worst of the isis prisoners turkey and the kurds must not let them escape europe should have taken them back after numerous requests they should do it now they will never come to or be allowed in the united states
somebody please explain to chris wallace of fox who will never be his father and my friend mike wallace that the phone conversation i had with the president of ukraine was a congenial good one it was only schiffs made up version of that conversation that was bad
serial killers get more due process than the democrats give to the president of the united states 
the democrats are trashing this president in the process trashing the us constitution frankly the american people need to wake up to the reality that the democrats are so drunk on power that theyre willing to destroy this constitutional republic 
adam schiff now doesnt seem to want the whistleblower to testify no must testify to explain why he got my ukraine conversation sooo wrong not even close did schiff tell him to do that we must determine the whistleblowers identity to determine why this was done to the usa
democrats game was foiled when we caught schiff fraudulently making up my ukraine conversation when i released the exact conversation transcript and when ukrainian president and the foreign minister said there was no pressure very normal talk a total impeachment scam
former democrat senator harry reid just stated that donald trump is very smart much more popular than people think is underestimated and will be hard to beat in the election thank you harry i agree
brian kilmeade over at got it all wrong we are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for years europe had a chance to get their isis prisoners but didnt want the cost let the usa pay they said
kurds may be releasing some to get us involved easily recaptured by turkey or european nations from where many came but they should move quickly big sanctions on turkey coming do people really think we should go to war with nato member turkey never ending wars will end
the same people who got us into the middle east mess are the people who most want to stay there
happy columbus day
vote for good guy tonight on dancing with the stars he has always been there for us
will be looking into the scott hapgood case and the island of anguilla something looks and sounds very wrong i know anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved 
wow hunter biden is being forced to leave a chinese company now watch the fake news wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him only softball questions of him please
america first
the fox impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect this was announced on friday despite this the corrupt new york times used this poll in one of its stories no mention
of the correction which they knew about full well fox news pollster braun research misrepresented impeachment poll analysis 
great new book resistance at all costs how trump haters are breaking america out by kimberley strassel of the wall street journal kim has treated us fairly and for that i am very appreciative check it out today it is great
to his credit the europeans didn't step up to deal with this isis problem its a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today now angela merkel of germany is finally stepping up and telling turkey to back off
don't the europeans have a lot of responsibility thank you katie i offered isis prisoners to the european countries from where they came and was rejected on numerous occasions they probably figured that the us would bear the tremendous cost as always
after defeating of the isis caliphate i largely moved our troops out of syria let syria and assad protect the kurds and fight turkey for their own land i said to my generals why should we be fighting for syria
and assad to protect the land of our enemy anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me whether it is russia china or napoleon bonaparte i hope they all do great we are miles away
some people want the united states to protect the mile away border of syria presided over by bashar alassad our enemy at the same time syria and whoever they chose to help wants naturally to protect the kurds
i would much rather focus on our southern border which abuts and is part of the united states of america and by the way numbers are way down and the wall is being built
statement from president donald j trump regarding turkeys actions in northeast syria 
the democrat party has hijacked the house of representatives twittercomszhfmhzec
it doesn't speak for the full house because the full house hasn't spoken the democrat party is pushing this impeachment this is a democrat party impeachment as i have been saying a silent coup effort twittercomsaegiybl
the house gone rogue i want to remind you a little bit about the ring leader in this whole rogue operation against the president of the united states twittercomekxsargph
shifty schiff now seems to think they dont need the whistleblower who started the whole scam the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcript also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned
a big scandal at news they got caught using really gruesome fake footage of the turks bombing in syria a real disgrace tomorrow they will ask softball questions to sleepy joe bidens son hunter like why did ukraine china pay you millions when you knew nothing payoff
project veritasobtained undercover videos highlight jeff zuckers campaign to destroy trump videos reveal s bias does this sound like a good or even great lawsuit
democrats are allowing no transparency at the witch hunt hearings if republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the fake news let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom i do not know they are interviewing for hours each not selective leaks
hunter biden was really bad on now sleepy joe has real problems reminds me of crooked hillary and her deleted emails not recoverable
governor has done a wonderful job for the people of kentucky he continues to protect your very important second amendment matt is strong on crime and the border he loves our great vets and military matt has my complete and total endorsement and always has

shifty adam schiff wants to rest his entire case on a whistleblower who he now says cant testify the reason he cant testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the presidential telephone call is a fraud totally different from the actual transcribed call
 it also brings shiftys fraudulent made up call which he read to the united states congress pretending it to be the words of president trump which they were not nancy pelosi is involved in this fraud in that she confirmed his fraudulent words on and much more
looks good to me 
a great group of champions 
we now have the greatest economy in history 
you would think there is no way that any of the democrat candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become president of the united states now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal absurd impeachment of one of the most successful presidents
what is happening to president trump with impeachment is a constitutional travesty the likes of which we have never seen before it is adam schiff and nancy pelosi who should be impeached for fraud
 approval rating in the republican party thank you just won two congressional seats in north carolina a governors runoff in louisiana which republicans should now win because of impeachment fraud we will easily take back the house add in the senate again win pres
our record economy would crash just like in if any of those clowns became president
republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this impeachment witch hunt no lawyers no questions no transparency the good news is that the radical left dems have no case it is all based on their fraud and fabrication
senator rand paul just wrote a great book the case against socialism which is now out highly recommended as america was founded on liberty independence not government coercion domination control we were born free and will stay free as long as i am your president
guatemala honduras el salvador have all signed historic asylum cooperation agreements and are working to end the scourge of human smuggling to further accelerate this progress the us will shortly be approving targeted assistance in the areas of law enforcement security

fake news

do you think they like me 
nervous nancy's unhinged meltdown 
the do nothing democrats pelosi and schumer stormed out of the cabinet room

years of bad government such a sorry thing to see 
hope all house republicans and honest house democrats will vote to censure rep adam schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating making up a totally phony conversation with the ukraine president and us president me most have never seen such a thing
about human beings were killed in syria while barack obama was president leading for a political settlement to that civil war media has been more outraged in the last hours over our syria policy than they were at any point during years of slaughter bucksexton
i am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops bring them home from the ridiculous costly endless wars and be scorned democrats always liked that position until i took it democrats always liked walls until i built them do you see whats happening here
this is the real story thank you jim 
my warmest condolences to the family and many friends of congressman elijah cummings i got to see first hand the strength passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader his work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard if not impossible to replace
the greatest witch hunt in american history 
as the witch hunt continues 
this number based on the economy how well our country is doing would potentially be if not for the fake news phony witch hunt approval rating in the republican party 
great news out of turkey news conference shortly with and thank you to millions of lives will be saved
this deal could never have been made days ago there needed to be some tough love in order to get it done great for everybody proud of all

the usa 
just spoke to president of turkey he told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated he very much wants the ceasefire or pause to work likewise the kurds want it and the ultimate solution to happen too bad there wasnt
this thinking years ago instead it was always held together with very weak bandaids in an artificial manner there is good will on both sides a really good chance for success the us has secured the oil the isis fighters are double secured by kurds turkey
i have just been notified that some european nations are now willing for the first time to take the isis fighters that came from their nations this is good news but should have been done after we captured them anyway big progress being made
defeat terrorism 
can you believe i am doing this important work for our country and have to deal with corrupt adam schiff and the do nothing democrats at the same time it was not intended to be this way for a president
i want to thank secretary of energy rick perry for the outstanding job he has done he will be leaving at the end of the year to pursue other interests rick was a great governor of texas and a great secretary of energy
he is also my friend at the same time i am pleased to nominate deputy secretary dan brouillette to be the new secretary of energy dans experience in the sector is unparalleled a total professional i have no doubt that dan will do a great job
think of how many lives we saved in syria and turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday thousands and thousands and maybe many more
republicans must stick together and fight 
corrupt congressman adam schiff is angry that ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent witch hunt are turning out to be good for me some really good hes got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks a very dishonest sleazebag
because the house has already voted against the impeachment proceeding the current inquiry is totally invalid the current sham of a socalled investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab it needs to end corrupt adam schiff
congressman michael mccaul schiffs inquiry defies democracy 
pelosi and impeachment there have already been votes and theyve all failed miserably heres why there may not be a fourth democrats voted against on the last vote many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 
susan rice who was a disaster to president obama as national security advisor is now telling us her opinion on what to do in syria remember red line in the sand that was obama millions killed no thanks susan you were a disaster
such a disgrace that the do nothing democrats are doing just as their name suggests doing nothing usmca anyone
there has never been a greater fraud on congress shifty schiff is corrupt go andy 
texas is great 
i agree 
thank you very much working hard 
i dont see anything that constitutes an impeachable offense nothing here rises to the level of impeachment the democrats are making a mistake with this secrecy kenn starr former special prosecutor
a great book by kimberley strassel 
 thank you tom great interview on 
just another fake suppression poll this time from of course 
it is only about this 
crooked hillary clinton just called the respected environmentalist and green party candidate jill stein a russian asset they need a green party more than ever after looking at the democrats disastrous environmental program
see you there 
the president never told me to withhold any money until the ukrainians did anything related to the server the only reason we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption yesterdays mick mulvaney statement
i thought i was doing something very good for our country by using trump national doral in miami for hosting the g leaders it is big grand on hundreds of acres next to miami international airport has tremendous ballrooms meeting rooms and each delegation would have
its own to unit building would set up better than other alternatives i announced that i would be willing to do it at no profit or if legally permissible at zero cost to the usa but as usual the hostile media their democrat partners went crazy
therefore based on both media democrat crazed and irrational hostility we will no longer consider trump national doral miami as the host site for the g in we will begin the search for another site including the possibility of camp david immediately thank you
never give up we are doing great we are winning 
so now crooked hillary is at it again she is calling congresswoman tulsi gabbard a russian favorite and jill stein a russian asset as you may have heard i was called a big russia lover also actually i do like russian people i like all people hillarys gone crazy
the wall is making a very big difference even dems in area are happy 
the ceasefire is holding up very nicely there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly new areas being resettled with kurds us soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone we have secured the oil mark esper secretary of defense ending endless wars
pelosi is now leading a delegation of including corrupt adam schiff to jordan to check out syria she should find out why obama drew the red line in the sand then did nothing losing syria all respect i did something missiles one million died under obamas mistake
this scam going on right now by the democrats against the republican party and me was all about a perfect phone call i had with the ukrainian president hes already stated no pressure where is the whistleblower or the nd whistleblower or the informant all gone
because their socalled story didnt come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call was it a corrupt adam schiff con why didnt the ig see this when do we depose shifty schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this
fiction to congress and the american people i demand his deposition he is a fraud just like the russia hoax was and the ukraine hoax is now when do the do nothing democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our country when do the republicans finally fight back
so interesting that when i announced trump national doral in miami would be used for the hosting of the g and then rescinded due to do nothing democratfake news anger very few in media mentioned that no profits would be taken or would be given free if legally permissible
to the democrats impeachment is partisan politics dressed up as principle 
congratulations barbara 
adam schiff is a corrupt politician 
a great democrat scam 
great new book by wonderful and very street smart author dan bongino exonerated the failed takedown of president donald trump by the swamp dan hits all of the crooked points of the greatest witch hunt in political history nevertheless the scam continues
censure at least corrupt adam schiff after what he got caught doing any pol who does not so vote cannot be honestare you listening dems
doral in miami would have been the best place to hold the g and free but too much heat from the do nothing radical left democrats their partner the fake news media im surprised that they allow me to give up my plus presidential salary well find someplace else
will be interviewed by tonight at pm on enjoy
thank you dan and kevin great vote 
thank you liz shows great republican support 
congratulations to on a wonderful and hard fought victory canada is well served i look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries
the ambassador to the european union has already testified he said there was no quid pro quo he said the president had told him that 
i thought a very revealing poll was done by the new york times by about a point margin those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the president and if nancy pelosi doesnt take note of that maybe she is the third rate politician 
a majority do not want him impeached and removed from office of the people in these battleground states who voted for president trump want him to continue as president thats squarely in his corner thats a revealing poll dont you think that matters
 i want to know about hillary clinton with the dossier i want to know if there was fisa abuse were still waiting for that report 
so some day if a democrat becomes president and the republicans win the house even by a tiny margin they can impeach the president without due process or fairness or any legal rights all republicans must remember what they are witnessing here a lynching but we will win
thank you republicans out of present voted for us last night really good
 approval rating in the republican party thank you
cant believe that nervous nancy pelosi isnt moving faster on usmca her people want it they dont know why she isnt putting it up for a bipartisan vote taking too long
the democrats are trying to draw out this inquiry because they dont have the support donald trump is guilty only of winning the election 
great job tim 
good news seems to be happening with respect to turkey syria and the middle east further reports to come later
wrong never even discussed this with kellyanne conway or steve mnuchin just more fake news 
the do nothing dems have nothing but time 
the witch hunt continues 
the democrats scam goes on and on they do nothing 
thank you steve 
it never ends the do nothing dems are terrible 
neither he taylor or any other witness has provided testimony that the ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld you cant have a quid pro quo with no quo congressman john ratcliffe where is the whistleblower the do nothing dems case is dead
republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the house because of what the do nothing democrats have done to our country
young campus conservatives are flocking to turning point usa other conservative speaker events all over the country and in record numbers thousands of students are turning out i just want to compliment the president of the united states for signing that historic executive
order a couple of months ago saying that any school that does not uphold the first amendment rights of its students will lose federal funding we have seen a huge change in how the universities interact with us as a national local student organization our studends
feel empowered theres a movement happening on these campuses like ive never seen before when you have students wanting to get into an event that couldnt get in thats pretty remarkable turning point usa keep america great
big success on the turkeysyria border safe zone created ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us captured isis prisoners secured i will be making a statement at am from the white house thank you
wheres the whistleblower
thank you general mazloum for your kind words and courage please extend my warmest regards to the kurdish people i look forward to seeing you soon 
the never trumper republicans though on respirators with not many left are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our country than the do nothing democrats watch out for them they are human scum
never trumper republican john bellinger represents never trumper diplomat bill taylor who i dont know in testimony before congress do nothing democrats allow republicans zero representation zero due process and zero transparency
does anybody think this is fair even though there was no quid pro quo im sure they would like to try worse than the dems
it would be really great if the people within the trump administration all wellmeaning and good i hope could stop hiring never trumpers who are worse than the do nothing democrats nothing good will ever come from them
it was wonderful to be back in pittsburgh pennsylvania with the incredible patriots who fuel our factories light up our homes power our industries and fill our hearts with true american pride 
promises made promises kept twittercomkckwkko
kiddingly were building a wall in coloradothen stated were not building a wall in kansas but they get the benefit of the wall were building on the border refered to people in the very packed auditorium from colorado kansas getting the benefit of the border wall
just a continuation of the witch hunt 
it is the only thing the do nothing dems are doing 
dont hurt them please 
the federal reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesnt lower the rate and even ideally stimulate take a look around the world at our competitors germany and others are actually getting paid to borrow money fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut
thank you to house republicans for being tough smart and understanding in detail the greatest witch hunt in american history it has been going on since long before i even got elected the insurance policy a total scam
the oil fields discussed in my speech on turkeykurds yesterday were held by isis until the united states took them over with the help of the kurds we will never let a reconstituted isis have those fields
i really enjoyed my conversation with general he appreciates what we have done and i appreciate what the kurds have done perhaps it is time for the kurds to start heading to the oil region
where is the whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the ukrainian president why did the ig allow this to happen who is the socalled informant schiff who was so inaccurate a giant scam
another big dropout of the presidential race was along with tim ryan such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show they stood for nothing and the voters couldnt stand by them obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end
so congressman tim ryan of ohio has finally dropped out of the race for president registering zero in the polls unable to even qualify for the debate stage see tim its not so easy out there if you dont know what youre doing he wasnt effective for usa workers just talk
turkey fully understands not to fire on the kurds as they leave what will be known as the safe zone for other fairly nearby areas i dont have to repeat that large scale sanctions will be imposed for violations going well isis secured by kurds with turkey ready as backup
usa has gained trillions of dollars in wealth since november all others way down our power is economic before having to use our newly rebuilt military a much better alternative oil is secured our soldiers have left and are leaving syria for other places then
coming home we were supposed to be there for days that was years ago when these pundit fools who have called the middle east wrong for years ask what we are getting out of the deal i simply say the oil and we are bringing our soldiers back home isis secured
donald j trump is an absolutely historic president already in less than years in office his record is there for everyone to look at to examine and compare this is an illegitimate effort to overthrow a president not a formal impeachment inquiry thank you lou

to tim the button on the iphone was far better than the swipe
democrats just announced that they no longer want the whistleblower to testify but everything was about the whistleblower they no longer want the second whistleblower either which they dont want because the account of my call bore no relationship to the call itself

my lawyers should sue the democrats and shifty adam schiff for fraud

we have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog name not declassified that did such a great job in capturing and killing the leader of isis abu bakr albaghdadi 
can you believe that shifty adam schiff the biggest leaker in dc and a corrupt politician is upset that we didnt inform him before we raided and killed the terrorist in the world wouldnt be surprised if the do nothing democrats impeach me over that drain the swamp
americans know by now that the impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the president from office jj crovatto dont worry jj schiff is a leaker corrupt politician who made up what i said on the call in order to hurt the republican party me
there is no underlying crime in that transcript correct and the whistleblower disappeared after i released the transcript of the call where is the whistleblower that is why this is now called the impeachment hoax the do nothing dems are doing nothing
the only crimes in the impeachment hoax were committed by shifty adam schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the ukrainian president and read it to congress together with numerous others on shiftys side schiff should be impeached and worse
this is a big win for america and also for president trump 
why are people that i never even heard of testifying about the call just read the call transcript and the impeachment hoax is over ukrain said no pressure 
correct a total scam 
a great book by a great guy get it now 
wheres the whistleblower just read the transcript everything else is made up garbage by shifty schiff and the never trumpers
the do nothing democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the best economy ever the monumental weekend raid tax cuts the rebuilding of our military etc the impeachment hoax is a disgrace read the transcript
how many more never trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is read the transcript i knew people were listening in on the call why would i say something inappropriate which was fine with me but why so many
supposedly according to the corrupt media the ukraine call concerned todays never trumper witness was he on the same call that i was cant be possible please ask him to read the transcript of the call witch hunt
 approval rating in the republican party a record thank you
just confirmed that abu bakr albaghdadis number one replacement has been terminated by american troops most likely would have taken the top spot now he is also dead
a great new book just out the plot against the president the true story of how congressman devin nunez uncovered the biggest political scandal in us history shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side check it out
consumer confidence number very good housing sales in september up nicely economy rocks
over in europe and japan they have negative rates they get paid to borrow money dont we have to follow our competitors yes we do the fed doesnt have a clue we have unlimited potential only held back by the federal reserve but we are winning anyway
nervous nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party our polls show that it is going to be just the opposite the do nothing dems will lose many seats in they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff
republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the impeachment hoax with the do nothing democrats and now are starting to go after the substance even more than the very infair process because just a casual reading of the transcript leads everybody to see that
the call with the ukrainian president was a totally appropriate one as he said no pressure this impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the witch hunt hoax which has been going on since before i even got elected rupublicans go with substance and close it out
the greatest economy in american history
it does appear it has to do with nancy pelosi retaining her speakership in the next congress she would like that so shes going to put it to a vote because thats what her political left really wants a disgraceful use of impeachment will backfire
a federal judge is allowing the nick sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting washington post which is no longer available at the white house he could now have a good chance of winning go nick
yesterdays never trumper witness could find no quid pro quo in the transcript of the phone call there were many people listening to the call how come they including the president of ukraine found nothing wrong with it witch hunt
precisely the same program that the democrats are trying to impeach president trump for supposedly slow walking tomorrow right here in the senate they the dems say theyre going to filibuster for the exact same program mitch mcconnell do nothing democrats
our country cannot afford for the democrats in congress to take a one year vacation from any productive legislation just because they would rather obsess over impeachment isis other radical terrorists are not going to hit the pause button because democrats wont fund
the united states military congress needs to do its work we need to fund our armed forces mitch mcconnell the dems are a lost cause in we need a big beautiful win all three 
my friend mike of the great state of alaska is being treated very unfairly by the democrats because he is doing an unbelievable job and fulfilling every one of his promises now they are trying to recall him because his agenda is the economy jobs and protecting

thank you daily wire very cute recreation but the live version of conan will be leaving the middle east for the white house sometime next week 
congratulations to the washington nationals on a great season and an incredible world series game was amazing 
now is the time for republicans to stand together and defend the leader of their party against these smears it would be one thing if there were any indication of an underlying crime but there is notnot in the transcripts and not in the secret witness testimony that
the dems have selectively leaked nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the president remember the president knew that that call was being heard and documented by many people anyone with intent would be a tad more discreet dont you think this farce should
never be allowed to roll into a winter showtrial indeed allowing a long drawn out trial in the senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the house the crisis is of the democrats own making and its up to republicans to make sure this never happens
to any president of either party again laura 
thank you matt 
congratulations to you left in the dust thats because the dont tell the truth

read the transcript it is perfect
schiff is giving republicans no witnesses no lawyer no due process it is a totally one sided witch hunt this cant be making the democrats look good such a farce
just like schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing
in order to continue being the most transparent president in history i will be releasing sometime this week the transcript of the first and therefore most important phone call i had with the president of ukraine i am sure you will find it tantalizing
schiff and the dems have created this whole thing they reverse engineer it theyve been vowing to impeach for three years why should we listen to them why should we want to 
the president has until september th to give this aid to ukraine he gets it out on september th weeks before the deadline so we give our ally aid and joe biden is not investigated remember that they get the aid and we get nothing in return the democrats
want that to be an impeachable offense good luck with that 
this isnt about ukraine this isnt about impeachment this is about subverting democracy so true and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves and must hate our country
a great try by we are all proud of you
why is such a focus put on nd and rd hand witnesses many of whom are never trumpers or whose lawyers are never trumpers when all you have to do is read the phone call transcript with the ukrainian president and see first hand he and others also stated that there was
no pressure put on him to investigate sleepy joe biden even though as president i have an obligation to look into corruption and bidens actions on tape about firing the prosecutor and his sons taking millions of dollars with no knowledge or talent from a
ukrainian energy company and more millions taken from china and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money are certainly looking very corrupt to put it mildly to me both bidens should be forced to testify in this no due process scam
i will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with the ukrainian president before weeks end
economy is booming seems set to have yet another record day
many of the people in daca no longer very young are far from angels some are very tough hardened criminals president obama said he had no legal right to sign order but would anyway if supreme court remedies with overturn a deal will be made with dems for them to stay
a total impeachment scam by the do nothing democrats 
daca recipients with arrest records that is a very large proportion of the total not good but we will be able to make a deal with the dems
this ridiculous impeachment is a travesty its not an inquiry just read the transcript 
the circus is coming to town the corrupt compromised coward congenital liar adam schiff show on capital hill brought to you by his raging psychotic democrats the top allies in the media mob everything youre going to see in the next two weeks is rigged
this is a phony showtrial there is zero due process none it is yet another fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory it is another witch hunt this is what the socialist doemocrat party has become theres not one thing the democrats have done in the past years except try
to hurt donald trump and we the people that support him the left has never accepted the results of the election they never saw this coming this is not just about president trump they hate everyone he is representing sean the amazing warrior
millions of americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is rush limbaugh also why is corrupt politician schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer did that lawyer ever work for me which would be a conflict
the democrats have stacked the deck against president trump and the republicans they have leaked out everything 
nancy pelosi cares more about power than she does about principle she did not want to go down this road she realizes this is a huge loser for democrats the founders envisioned the worst people being in politics yet they couldnt envision this you have these people taking
the most powerful tool the legislative branch has impeachment theyve turned it into a political cudgel which is not at all what the founders intended when you hear schiff use all these words like quid pro quo it is because they cant specify that donald trump broke
any laws or did anything wrong and they have to move away from quid pro quo because there was no quid and there was no quo ukraine got its money weeks early and there was no investigation 
never trumpers
read the transcript
thank you it is a time of shame for our country the democrats know what they are doing is wrong 
wow was just told that my sons book triggered is number one on the new york times bestseller list congratulations don
 asked the two star witnesses where is the impeachable event in that call both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face remained silent were unable to answer the question that would be the end of a case run by normal people but not shifty
hit new stock market record again yesterday the th time this year with great potential for the future usa is where the action is companies and jobs are coming back like never before
walmart announces great numbers no impact from tariffs which are contributing billions to our treasury inflation low do you hear that powell
neither one of the democrat star witnesses at the impeachment hearings could point out an impeachable offense thats the result 
that hearing was about a policy dispute robert ray regular people watching this cannot conclude that the president of the united states can be impeached 
 wsj nancy pelosi had it right the first time when she did not want to go down the impeachment path make it a voting issue but no the left insisted on raising this to the gravity of a constitutional crisis impeachment the hearings suggested its not going
anywhere so weve now had years of the democrats chasing donald trump nancy pelosis worried about the american voter looking for someone to blame for that eventually look at her own story in the house what have they done the average american cant identify anything
that the house democrats have done since shes become speaker other than chase donald trump this impeachment hoax is such a bad precedent and sooo bad for our country
wheres the fake whistleblower
we continue to monitor the terrible events at saugus high school in santa clarita california through our ongoing communications with local state and federal authorities

the impeachment witch hunt should be over with the statement made last night by the president and foreign minister of ukraine nervous nancy pelosi who should be home cleaning up the dangerous disgusting slum she is making of her district in san francisco where even the
filth pouring into the pacific ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard is getting nothing done she is a do nothing democrat as speaker and will hopefully not be in that position very long approve usmca which has been sitting on her desk for months
everywhere marie yovanovitch went turned bad she started off in somalia how did that go then fast forward to ukraine where the new ukrainian president spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him it is a us presidents absolute right to appoint ambassadors

republicans others must remember the ukrainian president and foreign minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever also they didnt even know the money wasnt paid and got the money with no conditions but why isnt germany france europe paying

president before what they are doing is not legal but im clean and when i release my financial statement my decision sometime prior to election it will only show one thing that i am much richer than people even thought and that is a good thing jobs jobs jobs
freed taliban hostages arrive in germany we got them back
i never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word impeachment the calls transcripts were perfect there was nothing said that was wrong no pressure on ukraine great corruption dishonesty by schiff on the other side
corrupt politician adam schiffs lies are growing by the day keep fighting tough republicans you are dealing with human scum who have taken due process and all of the republican partys rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in american history
but we are winning big and they will soon be on our turf
the new house resolution gives adam schiff the most dishonest man in politics the power unilaterally to release edited transcripts rule gives chairman schiff absolutely no jurisdiction subpoenas issued as part of dems impeachment inquiry are illegal sam dewey 
nothing gives schiff jurisdiction over impeachment
the navy will not be taking away warfighter and navy seal eddie gallaghers trident pin this case was handled very badly from the beginning get back to business
read the two transcripts of ukrainian calls
i have been watching people making phone calls my entire life my hearing is and has been great never have i been watching a person making a call which was not on speakerphone and been able to hear or understand a conversation ive even tried but to no avail try it live
ken starr former independent counsel does this reach the level of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors my assessment of the evidence so far no where close the evidence is conflicting ambiguous ambassador sondlands testimony stated that
president trump said the ukraine president should just do the right thing no quid pro quo you shouldnt charge but you cannot convict a sitting president on the basis of conflicting and ambiguous evidence and destabilize the american government thank you ken
iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire internet system so that the great iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country

 and i will soon release a plan to let florida and other states import prescription drugs that are much cheaper than what we have now hardworking americans dont deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need we are fighting daily to make sure this happens
while we had the first prescription drug price decrease in years americans still pay far too much for drugs other countries pay far less that is wrong we will soon be putting more options on the table
pelosi and her do nothing democrats drug pricing bill doesnt do the trick fewer cures fewer treatments time for the democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families
house republicans are showing real leadership and prepared to enact bipartisan solutions for drug prices do nothing democrats are playing partisan politics with your drug prices we are ready to work together if they actually want to get something done
the support for impeachment is not there i think the democrats will have to come up with a new game plan 
adam schiff will be compelled to testify should the democrats decide despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate perfect to go forward with the impeachment hoax polls have now turned very strongly against impeachment
joe concha the hill in emerson college poll impeachment among independents oppose support you see why pelosi is reluctant to go in with this dems have to go home and explain why they havent done something on opioid crisis drug prices usmca the border etc
the democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing the whistleblower the guy who took his case to schiffs staff first is what really blows the lid off this entire saga he worked for biden on ukraine policy when biden was vp he worked for deep state henchman john
brennan too and the whistleblower also worked for susan rice its an understatement to say that this is a witch hunt they spied on my campaign
daniel cameron who just won the ag race in the great commonwealth of kentucky is a young and very talented political star you will be hearing much from cameron in the years to come
new york post editorial worse than pointless all those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal to change americans minds part of the problem is that democrats already leaked the best evidence they had more important not one witness offered
any direct evidence that president trump did anything impeachable no one heard him order a quid pro quo no one offered a convincing reason why trumps interest in having ukraine probe potential cortuption warrants impeachment i want no quid pro quo ambassador
sondland said trump told him none of this will move the needle for anyone and now dems in swing districts head home for thanksgiving to hear from voters pelosi co are putting on a show to appease the democratic base instead of doing the work all americans need done
thank you kevin for the nice words 
 approval rate in the republican party a record thank you

democrats going back to their districts for thanksgiving are getting absolutely hammered by their constituents over the phony impeachment scam republicans will have a great election
i was not pleased with the way that navy seal eddie gallaghers trial was handled by the navy he was treated very badly but despite this was completely exonerated on all major charges i then restored eddies rank likewise large cost overruns from past administrations
contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction therefore secretary of the navy richard spencers services have been terminated by secretary of defense mark esper i thank richard for his service commitment eddie will retire peacefully with all of the
honors that he has earned including his trident pin admiral and now ambassador to norway ken braithwaite will be nominated by me to be the new secretary of the navy a man of great achievement and success i know ken will do an outstanding job
president trump is facing a process which is unprecedented for its unfairness sam dewey

when the military rips down an old badly broken border wall in an important location replaces it with a brand new ft high steel concrete wall nancy pelosi says we are not building a wall wrong and it is going up fast brandon judd just gave us great marks 
the dc wolves and fake news media are reading far too much into people being forced by courts to testify before congress i am fighting for future presidents and the office of the president other than that i would actually like people to testify don mcgahns respected
lawyer has already stated that i did nothing wrong john bolton is a patriot and may know that i held back the money from ukraine because it is considered a corrupt country i wanted to know why nearby european countries werent putting up money also likewise i would
love to have mike pompeo rick perry mick mulvaney and many others testify about the phony impeachment hoax it is a democrat scam that is going nowhere but future presidents should in no way be compromised what has happened to me should never happen to another president

trump economy breaks holiday shopping records 
it is clear that there is none of the bipartisan support that speaker pelosi said for months was essential for impeachment chris wallace 
brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the us from those countries the federal
reserve should likewise act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed
us markets are up as much as since the announcement of tariffs on and the us is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china
the process has been unfair republicans cant even get their own witnesses it gets me that adam schiff is not punishable for lying in any way 
the american people are going to see this for what it is it is a political effort by the democrats and the president certainly doesnt have to aid in the impeachment effort robert ray democrats are getting killed in their home districts 
the united states has outperformed the rest of the world in an eye popping fashion i dont think weve seen numbers like that mohamed elerian allianz chief economic adviser but despite this there is tremendous potential for growth far greater than most have understood
breaking news the president of ukraine has just again announced that president trump has done nothing wrong with respect to ukraine and our interactions or calls if the radical left democrats were sane which they are not it would be case over
the democrats dont have any evidence but they are still going to do it anyway thats the sham thats going on here chaffetz
when the law enforcers turn out to be the law breakers then we have totally upended the rule of law nobody is safe and everybody is in trouble our system of government is under attack

just landed in the united kingdom heading to london for nato meetings tomorrow prior to landing i read the republicans report on the impeachment hoax great job radical left has no case read the transcripts shouldnt even be allowed can we go to supreme court to stop
mini mike bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any democrat but to go after president trump only the failing new york times thinks that is ok because their hatred bias is so great they cant even see straight its not ok
true 
the united states of america supports the brave people of iran who are protesting for their freedom we have under the trump administration and always will
too bad we will miss you kamala 
thank you 
enjoyed my meeting with prime minister of the united kingdom at last night talked about numerous subjects including and trade
great progress has been made by nato over the last three years countries other than the us have agreed to pay billion dollars more per year and by that number will be billion dollars nato will be richer and stronger than ever before
just finished meetings with turkey and germany heading to a meeting now with those countries that have met their goals followed by meetings with denmark and italy
when todays meetings are over i will be heading back to washington we wont be doing a press conference at the close of nato because we did so many over the past two days safe travels to all
the fake news media is doing everything possible to belittle my very successful trip to london for nato i got along great with the nato leaders even getting them to pay billion a year more billion a year more in years no increase for us only deep respect
 has now recognized space as an operational domain and the alliance is stronger for it us leadership ensures peace through strength and we must continue to show strength and win on all fronts land air sea and space
just read the best maureen dowd column in the new york times ever although she treated me great before politics but it was written by her brother kevin someone in the news media should hire her wonderful talented and very smart brother 
when i said in my phone call to the president of ukraine i would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about it with the word us i am referring to the united states our country i then went on to say that
i would like to have the attorney general of the united states call you or your people this based on what i have seen is their big point and it is no point at a all except for a big win for me the democrats should apologize to the american people
tremendous things achieved for us on my nato trip proudly for our country no president has ever achieved so much in so little time without a us increase other countries have already increased by billionwith billion soon such a thing has never been done before
the do nothing democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the house they have no impeachment case and are demeaning our country but nothing matters to them they have gone crazy therefore i say if you are going to impeach me do it now fast so we can have a fair
trial in the senate and so that our country can get back to business we will have schiff the bidens pelosi and many more testify and will reveal for the first time how corrupt our system really is i was elected to clean the swamp and thats what i am doing
the do nothing radical left democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to impeach me over nothing they already gave up on the ridiculous mueller stuff so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate perfect phone calls with the ukrainian president
this will mean that the beyond important and seldom used act of impeachment will be used routinely to attack future presidents that is not what our founders had in mind the good thing is that the republicans have never been more united we will win
thank you twittercomvkfvhqnxe

with the us presidential election in november north korea under the leadership of kim jong un has tremendous economic potential but it must denuclearize as promised nato china russia japan and the entire world is unified on this issue
less than hours before start of the impeachment hearing hoax on monday the no due process do nothing democrats are believe it or not changing the impeachment guidelines because the facts are not on their side when you cant win the game change the rules
 the democrats are now admitting that they cant prove a crime they cant prove a law was violated and heres why any president any administration is justified in investigating corruption and there was serious evidence of real corruption concerning hunter
biden on the board of the largest natural gas company in ukraine getting paid a month times as much as a board member of thank you ted he also made a fortune from china and others but zero before his father became vp 
any president has the authority to investigate corruption the president himself released the transcript of the call now the democrats have no evidence of a crime and no evidence of violating the law this is a kangaroo court in the house but its going to go to the senate
its going to go nowhere they are going to impeach not because they have the evidence but because they hate the president i think the american people know that this is a waste of time this is democrats putting on a circus interviewed by sleepy eyes chuck todd
dont get why puts losers on like who got zero as presidential candidate before quitting pramila jayapal david cicilline and others who are radical left haters the dems wouldnt let get near their bad ratings debates yet fox panders pathetic
great 
i got nato countries to pay billion dollars a year more and the us less and came home to a fake news media that mocked me didnt think that was possible
the wall is going up fast 
i think the democrats are going to lose many members over this 
ig report out tomorrow that will be the big story
the democrats havent come up with a smocking gun nancy pelosi by raising this to the level of impeachment has raised the bar impossibly high this comes after three years of nonstop investigations of trump the russian collusion narrative the mueller report now the
american people are supposed to believe that this simply isnt a part of everthing theyve been trying to do for the last three years i think it is really a hard sell for nancy pelosi the wall street journal
this would be the first impeachment in american history without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president whose impeached would have allegedly committed paul gigot the wall street journal
what he did is illegal schiff is a corrupt politician and a criminal 
cnn is a ratings disaster lost all credibility 
no president in american history has been treated like this 
the democrats have thrown a wrecking ball at our democracy 
america first 
let our great soldiers fight 
witch hunt

witch hunt

a great choice bill is a winner 
you have to look at the instances of misconduct cited in the report they are very bad the fisa court was clearly taken for a ride on this a failure of the fbi up and fown the chain of command its about as strong a medicine as ive seen in a report of this kind
in a very long time the fbi has had some dark day in its past but nothing like this this was very serious misconduct on the part of the fbi are you listening comey mccabe lovers lisa peter the beautiful ohr family brennan clapper many more
i dont know what report current director of the fbi christopher wray was reading but it sure wasnt the one given to me with that kind of attitude he will never be able to fix the fbi which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men women working there
i cant remember anything quite like this the ig report 
to impeach a president who has proven through results including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our countrys history to have one of the most successful presidencies ever and most importantly who has done nothing wrong is sheer political madness 
americas great usmca trade bill is looking good it will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the usa good for everybody farmers manufacturers energy unions tremendous support importantly we will finally end our countrys worst trade deal nafta

i also have constantly asked why arent germany france and other european countries helping ukraine more they are the biggest beneficiaries why is it always the good ol united states the radical left do nothing democrats never mention this at their phony hearing
i think its obvious to all the american public that this is a railroad job twittercommlynnypqg
 this is so surreal for three years this president has been harassed hes been electronically surveilled spied upon allegations have never ceased they continue and their continuing today at some point you would think you would look at the abuse
by congress by the justice department fbi friends of the democrats who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate at some point somebody should have said wait a minute this is out of control this train is off the tracks its time to get reasonable
whats gone on the last three years is not reasonable the majority has been so abusive
nancy pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for two and a half years in other words she lied this was the radical left do nothing democrats plan all along long before the ukraine phone call impeachment hoax

poll numbers have gone through the roof in favor of no impeachment especially with swing states and independents in swing states people have figured out that the democrats have no case it is a total hoax even pelosi admitted yesterday that she began this scam years ago
the do nothing democrats have become the party of lies and deception the republicans are the party of the american dream
the republican party is more united now than at any time in its history by far

the wall street journal story on the china deal is completely wrong especially their statement on tariffs fake news they should find a better leaker
we have agreed to a very large phase one deal with china they have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of agricultural product energy and manufactured goods plus much more the tariffs will remain as is with put on much of the remainder
the penalty tariffs set for december th will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal we will begin negotiations on the phase two deal immediately rather than waiting until after the election this is an amazing deal for all thank you
this whole process has been rigged from the start 
happy birthday twittercomimnczcchgn
its not fair that im being impeached when ive done absolutely nothing wrong the radical left do nothing democrats have become the party of hate they are so bad for our country
the fbi declares in a court filing that it has absolutely no records of disciplinary action against any lawyers in russia fisa case despite acts of misconduct there is nothing noble about their leadership fisa court appears to be either corrupt or incompetent 
 million evangelical christians are not registered to vote we are working hard to get them registered 
after watching the disgraceful way that a wonderful man was treated by the democrats and now seeing first hand how these same radical left do nothing dems are treating the whole impeachment hoax i understand why so many dems are voting republican
independent voters are fed up and frustrated with the democrats congressman michael waltz florida
there are house democrats in trump won congressional districts those dems will have to answer to their constituents come if you look at the facts theres no crime theres no witness theres no evidence theres no victim president zelensky said there was
absolutely no pressure i dont know of any crime that was committed where the actual victim wasnt aware of itand they got the call they got the meeting and they got the money unbelievably the democrats have weaponized the impeachment process they have
trampled on our constitution and they have done irreparable harm to our republic the american people are going to speak up and speak out about this i think this guarantees trumps reelection in 
on my way to the in philadelphia pennsylvania 
chuck schumer sat for years during the obama administration and watched as china ripped off the united states he the do nothing democrats did nothing as this carnage took place now without even seeing it he snipes at our great new deal with china too bad cryin chuck

so now comeys admitting he was wrong wow but hes only doing so because he got caught red handed he was actually caught a long time ago so what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct could it be years in jail where are the apologies to me and others jim

the american people see through it 
read the transcripts the impeachment hoax is the greatest con job in the history of american politics the fake news media and their partner the democrat party are working overtime to make life for the united republican party and all it stands for as difficult as possible
i look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched do nothing democrat debates my record is so good on the economy and all else including debating that perhaps i would consider more than debates
the problem is that the socalled commission on presidential debates is stacked with trump haters never trumpers years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against crooked hillary as president the debates are up
to me and there are many options including doing them directly avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased commission i will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime the commission on presidential debates is not authorized to speak for me or rs
thank you devin great reflexes 
wow 
new stock market high i will never get bored of telling you that and we will never get tired of winning

wow in a stunning rebuke of the fbi the fisa court severly chastised the fbi for the fisa abuses brought to light in the recent inspector generals report there were at least significant errors statement by the court was long and tough means my case was a scam
democrat leadership despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous impeachment if they vote yes it will be much easier for republicans to win in 
good marks and reviews on the letter i sent to pelosi today she is the worst no wonder with people like her and cryin chuck schumer dc has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who and now we know for sure spied on my campaign
so if comey the top people in the fbi were dirty cops and cheated on the fisa court wouldnt all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed they went after me with the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary the dnc which they illegally presented to fisa
they want to impeach me im not worried and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways how can they do that and yet impeach a very successful economy plus president of the united states who has done nothing wrong these people are crazy
 voters say the democrats are trying to take away their votes pelosi was right the first time impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the democrats how can you impeach the president for going to the courts
 my hope is that impeachment will never become this trivial again well said brian
can you believe that i will be impeached today by the radical left do nothing democrats and i did nothing wrong a terrible thing read the transcripts this should never happen to another president again say a prayer
they just wanted to get at the president they had no intention of having a proper investigation they couldnt find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of congress which every administration from the beginning has done 
its sad heres a gentleman who came to the white house and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath all they wanted to do is impeach him they started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in but this president came to washington and
said im going to clean up washington im going to help people he gave big tax cuts hes made our military strong theyre mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do history will record were experiencing some of the best times weve ever
had while the democrats are just looking out for elections this president should just continue to fight like hes always fought for himself for this country continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs trade policies thats what makes this president stand
out and hes been amazing at it the democrsts have no message they have no hope for thank you doug
sean is a great patriot and will do a fantastic job has my total and complete endorsement 
sean p is a much stronger candidate 
thank you

impeachment is a terrible idea for the country the more people learn about impeachment the less people want impeachment 
thank you 
will go down in history as worst speaker already thrown out once 
the evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not its not even close ken starr former independent counsel
in the end here nothing happened we dont approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a president should be removed from office i believe that a president cant be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the senate
wont convict and remove the president then the house should not be impeaching the president in the first place if this is the new standard every president from here on out is impeachable andy mccarthy so well stated thank you
such atrocious lies by the radical left do nothing democrats this is an assault on america and an assault on the republican party
thank you michigan i am on my way see everybody soon twittercomgpsbhcn
thank you 
 republican vote thats what people are talking about the republicans are united like never before
the senate shall set the time and place of the trial if the do nothing democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by default
presidential harassment
i got impeached last night without one republican vote being cast with the do nothing dems on their continuation of the greatest witch hunt in american history now the do nothing party want to do nothing with the articles not deliver them to the senate but its senates call
this is what the dems are dealing with does anyone think this is good for the usa 
our great congressman gohmert is a true patriot fighting back against people that must hate our country 
thank you anne 
thank you terrence 
thank you rena 
pelosi feels her phony impeachment hoax is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the senate which can set a date and put this whole scam into default if they refuse to show up the do nothings are so bad for our country
jesse watters this is the best year any president has ever had plus we get an impeachment the five 
the great usmca trade deal mexico canada has been sitting on nancy pelosis desk for months she doesnt even know what it says today after passing by a wide margin in the house pelosi tried to take credit for it labor will vote for trump trade deal is great for usa
so after the democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the senate how to run their trial actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up they want out i want an immediate trial
the house democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the republicans on their impeachment hoax the republicans have never been so united the dems case is so bad that they dont even want to go to trial
the reason the democrats dont want to submit the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they dont want corrupt politician adam shifty schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the whistleblower the missing second whistleblower the informer the bidens to testify
this is political malpractice this is a horrible judgement call on the part of the speaker you put your members in trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot its only going to extend it out further this looks like the joke that it actually is ben domenech
whats been revealed is a country in better shape than its been in decades working men and women in the country are the beneficiaries of a president whos doing exactly what he said he was going to do that is to restore prosperity for all americans thank you lou
house democrats perpetrating a fraud on america

the democrats and crooked hillary paid for provided a fake dossier with phony information gotten from foreign sources pushed it to the corrupt media dirty cops have now been caught they spied on my campaign then tried to cover it up just like watergate but bigger
pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the us congress and now she is crying for fairness in the senate and breaking all rules while doing so she lost congress once she will do it again
nancy pelosi who has already lost the house speakership once is about to lose it again is doing everything she can to delay the zero republican vote articles of impeachment she is trying to take over the senate cryin chuck is trying to take over the trial no way
what right does crazy nancy have to hold up this senate trial none she has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision this witch hunt must end now with a trial in the senate or let her default lose no more time should be wasted on this impeachment scam
wouldnt it be reasonable to assume that republicans in the senate should handle the impeachment hoax in the exact same manner as democrats in the house handled their recent partisan scam why would it be different for republicans than it was for the radical left democrats
i agree 
nasdaq up since our great election victory dow up the best is yet to come
stock market closes at alltime high what a great time for the radical left do nothing democrats to impeach your favorite president especially since he has not done anything wrong
what the democrats are doing is obstruction of the senate its wrong constitutionally its wrong morally and its wrong politically l agree and so does the public
the real victims here are the american people and the constitution the constitution has been damaged by this ploy being used by nancy pelosi this is a very bad time for the united states constitution 
everything were seeing from speaker pelosi and senator schumer suggests that theyre in real doubt about the evidence theyve brought forth so far not being good enough and are very very urgently seeking a way to find some more evidence the only way to make this work is to
mount some kind of public pressure to demand witnesses but mcconnell has the votes and he can run this trial anyway he wants to

why should crazy nancy pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the house be allowed to impeach the president of the united states got zero republican votes there was no crime the call with ukraine was perfect with no pressure she said it must be bipartisan
 overwhelming but this scam impeachment was neither also very unfair with no due process proper representation or witnesses now pelosi is demanding everything the republicans werent allowed to have in the house dems want to run majority republican senate hypocrites
look the house is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents before they send the articles over to the senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents that work is supposed to be done in the house 
the radical left do nothing democrats said they wanted to rush everything through to the senate because president trump is a threat to national security they are vicious will say anything but now they dont want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly liars

our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterdays church attack it was over in seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect fellow worshippers lives were saved by these heroes and texas laws allowing them to carry arms

iran killed an american contractor wounding many we strongly responded and always will now iran is orchestrating an attack on the us embassy in iraq they will be held fully responsible in addition we expect iraq to use its forces to protect the embassy and so notified
armed congregants quickly stopped a crazed church shooter in texas if it were not for the fact that there were people inside of the church that were both armed and highly proficient in using their weapon the end result would have been catastrophic a big thank you to them

remember when pelosi was screaming that president trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly they didnt get one republican house vote and lost dems they produced no case so now she doesnt want to go to the senate shes all lies most overrated person i know
its my opinion as a lawyer that the articles of impeachment are defective on their face which means i would like to see a motion to dismiss and have this disbursed without the necessity of a trial i dont think there should be a trial i think it should be dismissed
on votes which is procedural you dont need two thirds brad blakeman a great lawyer person thank you brad
this guy peter strzok was organizing a coup to undo the election rachel camposduffy and he wasnt the only one in that administration the greatest witch hunt in american history

they dont know how to do that 
sohrab ahmari new york post the trump campaign raised million in the two days following the impeachment scam vote it seems the democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way they set up a process they know is not going to lead to the presidents removal 
its alienating independents this president is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another and that really plays to his base their partisan witch hunt is hurting our country do badly only bringing more division than ever
a lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of dirty filthy cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started that spied on my campaign the witch hunt is sputtering badly but still going on ukraine hoax if this
had happened to a presidential candidate or president who was a democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason and more and it would be considered the crime of the century far bigger and more sinister than watergate
iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation
general qassem soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught he was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number
of protesters killed in iran itself while iran will never be able to properly admit it soleimani was both hated and feared within the country they are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe he should have been taken out many years ago
the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year for many years that is on top of all else we have done for them the people of iraq dont want to be dominated controlled by iran but ultimately that is their choice over the last years iran has gained more
and more control over iraq and the people of iraq are not happy with that it will never end well
this is a great book a must read 
christopher bedford the federalist senior editor there is nothing new in these emails at all thats been discovered its exactly what we knew before which is that the white house political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of
different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending us taxpayer money there was a back forth over the legal arguments the wh decision was
followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said hes going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because its never actually been brought to trial
 approval rating in the republican party thank you
as hard as i work as successful as our country has become with our economy our military everything else it is ashame that the democrats make us spend so much time money on this ridiculous impeachment lite hoax i should be able to devote all of my time to the real usa
iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain usa assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an american badly wounded many others not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime including recently
hundreds of iranian protesters he was already attacking our embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations iran has been nothing but problems for many years let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans or american assets we have
targeted iranian sites representing the american hostages taken by iran many years ago some at a very high level important to iran the iranian culture and those targets and iran itself will be hit very fast and very hard the usa wants no more threats
they attacked us we hit back if they attack again which i would strongly advise them not to do we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before 
the united states just spent two trillion dollars on military equipment we are the biggest and by far the best in the world if iran attacks an american base or any american we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their wayand without hesitation
these media posts will serve as notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any us person or target the united states will quickly fully strike back perhaps in a disproportionate manner such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless
the reason they are not sending the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic the great scam continues to be spending time on this political hoax at this moment in our history when i am so busy is sad
the impeachment hoax just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before i won the election must end quickly read the transcripts see the ukrainian presidents strong statement no pressure get this done it is a con game by the dems to help with the election
congress the president should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan impeachment hoax when we have so many important matters pending to zero was the republican house vote we got dems this was not what the founders had in mind
iran will never have a nuclear weapon
the homeless situation in los angeles san francisco and many other democrat party run cities throughout the nation is a state and local problem not a federal problem
if however the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility and politely asks for help from the federal government we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run democrat cities great again
amazing analysis reporting 
we love australia 
great interview with kevin mccarthy on there was no urgency with the articles of impeachment because there was no case

michael goodwin new york post trumps peace through strength philosophy is what america needs his john kerry claim bears no relation to reality the agreement didnt create opportunities for america other signatories to confront irans malign activities it overlooked
pelosi has made a mockery of impeachment her articles are so weak but more importantly she thought she could extort the senate she couldnt the do nothing democrats are really run by the radical left too bad
great idea this phony impeachment hoax should not even be allowed to proceed did nothing wrong just a partisan vote zero republicans never happened before 
why did nervous nancy allow corrupt politician shifty schiff to lie before congress he must be a witness and so should she
why should i have the stigma of impeachment attached to my name when i did nothing wrong read the transcripts a totally partisan hoax never happened before house republicans voted with three dems voting with the republicans very unfair to tens of millions of voters
house republicans investigating origins of the ukraine whistleblower complaint icig michael atkinson facing serious questions the democrats know the icig is a major problemdidnt release his testimony looks so much like everything else weve seen from the russia hoax to
the ukraine hoax that became the impeachment scam must get the icig answers by friday because this is the guy who lit the fuse so if he wants to clear his name prove that his office is indeed incompetent the icig never wanted proof
wow crazy bernie sanders is surging in the polls looking very good against his opponents in the do nothing party so what does this all mean stay tuned
many believe that by the senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence no crime read the transcripts no pressure impeachment hoax rather than an outright dismissal it gives the partisan democrat witch hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have i agree

bernie sanders volunteers are trashing elizabeth pocahontus warren everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters mini mike b is also trying but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast elizabeth is very angry at bernie do i see a feud brewing
the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy only because i did what should have been done for years anything i do whether its the economy military or anything else will be scorned by the rafical left do nothing democrats
wow the wonderful iranian protesters refused to step on or in any way denigrate our great american flag it was put on the street in order for them to trample it and they walked around it instead big progress
the fake news media and their democrat partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist soleimani was imminent or not was my team in agreement the answer to both is a strong yes but it doesnt really matter because of his horrible past
really big breaking news kidding booker who was in zero polling territory just dropped out of the democrat presidential primary race now i can rest easy tonight i was sooo concerned that i would someday have to go head to head with him
we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldnt let us have witness no lawyers or even ask questions it was the most unfair witchhunt in the history of congress
i stand stronger than anyone in protecting your healthcare with preexisting conditions i am honored to have terminated the very unfair costly and unpopular individual mandate for you

years from now when we look back at this day nobodys going to remember nancys cheap theatrics they will remember though how president trump brought the chinese to the bargaining table and delivered achievements few ever thought were possible 
there is no crime here entertaining this impeachment is a joke this whole thing should be dismissed 
mini mike bloomberg doesnt get on the democrat debate stage because he doesnt want to he is a terrible debater and speaker if he did he would go down in the polls even more if that is possible
